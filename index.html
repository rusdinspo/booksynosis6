Born into slavery, mulatto Elizabeth Keckly was Mary Lincoln&#x2019;s dressmaker, confidante, and mainstay during the difficult years that the Lincolns occupied the White House and the early years of Mary&#x2019;s widowhood. But she was a fascinating woman in her own right, independent and already well-established as the dressmaker to the Washington elite when she was first hired by Mary Lincoln upon her arrival in the nation&#x2019;s capital. Lizzy had bought her freedom in 1855 and come to Washington determined to make a life for herself as a free black, and she soon had Washington correspondents reporting that &#x201c;stately carriages stand before her door, whose haughty owners sit before Lizzy docile as lambs while she tells them what to wear.&#x201d; Mary Lincoln had hired Lizzy in part because she was considered a &#x201c;high society&#x201d; seamstress and Mary, an outsider in Washington&#x2019;s social circles, was desperate for social cachet. With her husband struggling to keep the nation together, Mary turned increasingly to her seamstress for companionship, support, and advice&#x2014;and over the course of those trying years, Lizzy Keckly became her confidante and closest friend.<br><br>With <i>Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Keckly</i>, pioneering historian Jennifer Fleischner allows us to glimpse the intimate dynamics of this unusual friendship for the first time, and traces the pivotal events that enabled these two women&#x2014;one born to be a mistress, the other to be a slave&#x2014;to forge such an unlikely bond at a time when relations between blacks and whites were tearing the nation apart. Beginning with their respective childhoods in the slaveholding states of Virginia and Kentucky, their story takes us through the years of tragic Civil War, the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and the early Reconstruction period. An author in her own right, Keckly wrote one of the most detailed biographies of Mary Lincoln ever published, and though it led to a bitter feud between the friends, it is one of the many rich resources that have enhanced Fleischner&#x2019;s trove of original findings.<br><br>A remarkable, riveting work of scholarship that reveals the legacy of slavery and sheds new light on the Lincoln White House, <i>Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Keckly</i> brings to life a mesmerizing, intimate aspect of Civil War history, and underscores the inseparability of black and white in our nation&#x2019;s heritage.</p><p>The improbable friendship of Mary Lincoln, daughter of a slaveholder, and Elizabeth Keckly, daughter of a slave, so ably recreated and documented in Fleischner's dual biography, challenges much of what we think we know about nineteenth-century American color consciousness, black as well as white.&nbsp; Without understanding Lincoln's attachment to Keckly, we can never appreciate the contradictions that made the First Lady so controversial.&nbsp; Without recognizing Keckly's role in the Lincoln family, our awareness of African American influence on the politics of nation in the 1860s remains incomplete.<br><b>--William L. Andrews, E. Maynard Adams Professor of English, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, editor of&nbsp;<i>Classic African American Women's Narratives,</i> and co-editor of the <i>Norton Anthology of African American Literature</i><br>&nbsp; <br></b>&#x201c;An excellent, illuminating book that offers a fresh vision of Mary Lincoln, acquaints us with the exceedingly interesting Elizabeth Keckly, and provides new insight into race, women&#x2019;s lives, and American society in the 19th century.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2013;William Lee Miller, author of <i>Lincoln&#x2019;s Virtues: An Ethical Biography</i><br></b><br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i><b>Jennifer Fleischner</b> was awarded a one-year Mellon Faculty Fellowship in Afro-American Studies at Harvard, where she researched and taught alongside such colleagues as Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Also the author of <i>Mastering Slavery</i>, she is now Chair of the English Department at Adelphi University.</p><h2>Notes From the Sofa</h2><p><p>From the beloved and bestselling author of <i>The Snowman</i> comes his first book in ten years: a charming and beautifully illustrated work for adults. In <i>Notes from the Sofa</i>, Raymond Briggs traces the course of his life in a series of wonderfully observed vignettes that take him from the awkwardness and embarrassment of growing up to the vicissitudes and frustrations of growing old.</p><p>This collection features the best pieces from Briggs' regular column &#x2013; "Notes from the Sofa" &#x2013; in <i>The Oldie</i>, Richard Ingrams' humorous monthly magazine. Amusing and touching by turn, these include his unwavering dedication to the arts and why he takes pleasure in being labelled a 'creative sociopath'; amusing anecdotes, such as how he became an accidental <i>Winnie the Pooh </i>tour guide to Japanese tourists; and general musings on life, including his confusion as a young child as to exactly where babies come from.</p><p>This is Briggs like you've never read him before, with a newfound freedom to write and draw about whatever he wants, without the restrictions of children's books and sometimes without the happy endings.</p></p><p><b>Raymond Briggs</b> is one of our most respected and beloved artists. Born in Wimbledon Park in 1934, he studied at the Wimbledon School of Art and later at the Slade School of Fine Art, and went on to produce a treasure trove of work. He has created characters that are now icons for generations of children, including <i>Fungus the Bogeyman</i>, <i>Father Christmas</i> and, of course, the beloved <i>Snowman</i>.

Raymond lives in Sussex.</p><h2>Urso Brunov and the White Emperor</h2><p>Although tiny in size, the gigantically courageous Urso Brunov, the Little Father of All Bears, quickly rushes to assist two young polar bears who got lost in a forest after hearing the call of hungry wolves nearby.</p><p>Brian Jacques lives in Liverpool, England. <p> Alexi Natchev lives in Newark, Delaware.</p>Grade 1&#x2013;3&#x2014;Urso Brunov, the "Little Father of All Bears," is "mighty in battle/strong as an elephant/fierce as a lion/and wise as the wisest old owl of the forests." Tiny in stature but formidable in spirit, he and his bugle are called by the Silvery Moon Lady and led by Old Uncle Wind to aid two missing polar bears, threatened by ravenous wolves. Using his instrument to separate these attackers, Brunov promises to protect the royal bear siblings by guiding them home to the Land of Rainbow Lights. Relying on his friends, the boars, the deer, and the king of the whales, the lost bears safely return to their magical ice palace. Meeting their leader, the White Emperor Balanco, Brunov is rewarded with festivities. This fanciful sequel to <i>The Tale of Urso Brunov</i> (Philomel, 2003) features nondescript watercolor illustrations, though they are enhanced by cool colors, capturing the icy setting. Descriptive language develops Brunov's character; however, the lengthy narrative, featuring numerous brief appearances by minor characters, may prevent this selection from reaching a wide audience.&#x2014;<i>Meg Smith, Cumberland County Public Library, Fayetteville, NC</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Spanning the journal entries in an eleven-year period from December 12, 1941, to July 5, 1952, Entering the Silence unfolds Merton&#39;s budding literary career and the development of his spiritual ideas in a uniquely personal literary style that would propel his writings into the mainstream. As the demands of his literary success rose, so did the tensions between remaining an observant monk and a talented, prolific writer. Faithful to both of these passions, Merton struggled with the requirements of daily monastic life while he continued to grace the world with his fresh observations and profound insights.</p><p><i>"Let me keep silence in this world, except in so far as God wills and in the way He wills it. Let me at least disappear into the writing I do. It should mean nothing special to me, nor harm my recollection. The work could be a prayer; its results should not concern me."-</i>Thomas Merton<i>,</i> December 14, 1946 <p> During his arduous days and nights in the silence of the monastery, the young Thomas Merton simultaneously advanced to priesthood and emerged as a surprising bestselling author when his spiritual autobiography, <i>The Seven Story Mountain</i>, was published in 1948.

"At work -- writing -- I am doing a little better. I mean, I am less tied up in it, more peaceful and detached. Taking one thing at a time and going over it slowly and patiently and forgetting the other jobs that have to take their turn." </p><p> As Merton's talent as a writer blossomed, he eloquently reconciled his spiritual life with his writing life, drawing deep connection between the two.</p>Thomas Merton (1915-1968) was a Trappist monk, writer and peace activist.

Against his father&#x2019;s will, and with nothing but a dream and an insatiable urge to create a new style of art that repudiated the Classical Realism of the time, he set off for Paris.<br>&nbsp;<br>But once there he is confronted with obstacles: an art world that refused to validate his style, extreme poverty, and a war that led him away from his home and friends. But there were bright spots as well: his deep, enduring friendships with men named Renoir, C�zanne, Pissarro, Manet &#x2013; a group that together would come to be known as the Impressionists, and that supported each other through the difficult years. But even more illuminating was his lifelong love, Camille Doncieux, a beautiful, upper-class Parisian girl who threw away her privileged life to be by the side of the defiant painter and embrace the lively Bohemian life of their time. <br>&nbsp;<br>His muse, his best friend, his passionate lover, and the mother to his two children, Camille stayed with Monet&#x2014;and believed in his work&#x2014;even as they lived in wretched rooms, were sometimes kicked out of those, and often suffered the indignities of destitution. She comforted him during his frequent emotional torments, even when he would leave her for long periods to go off on his own to paint in the countryside.<br>&nbsp;<br>But Camille had her own demons &#x2013; secrets that&nbsp; Monet could never penetrate, including one that when eventually revealed would pain him so deeply that he would never fully recover from its impact. For though Camille never once stopped loving the painter with her entire being, she was not immune to the loneliness that often came with being his partner. <br>&nbsp;<br>A vividly-rendered portrait of both the rise of Impressionism and of the artist at the center of the movement, <i>Claude and Camille</i> is above all a love story of the highest romantic order.</p><p>STEPHANIE COWELL is the author of <i>Nicholas Cooke: Actor, Soldier, Physician, Priest</i>; <i>The Physician of London</i> (American Book Award 1996) and <i>The Players: A Novel of the Young Shakespeare</i>.

Through the open window he could hear the sound of a few flies buzzing near one of the flower beds, and the voices of the gardener and his son, who were talking softly as they pushed their wheelbarrow over the paths of the vast garden.<br><br>He had meant to paint his water lily pond again, but after the letter had come he could do nothing. Even now, he felt the bitter words rising from the ink. &#x201c;Why do you write me after all these years, Monet? I still hold you responsible for the death of my sister, Camille. There can be no communication between us.&#x201d;<br><br>Outside, the day was ending, smelling of sweet grass and roses. He swallowed the last of his wine and stood suddenly, smoothing the letter and thrusting it in his pocket. &#x201c;You foolish woman,&#x201d; he said under his breath. &#x201c;You never understood.&#x201d;<br><br>Head lowered, he made his way up the stairs to the top floor, under the sloping attic roof, and down the hall to the locked door. He had worked in this small studio briefly when he first moved here years before and could not remember the last time he had gone inside.<br><br>Dust lay on the half-used tubes of paint on the table; palette knives and brushes of every size rested in jars. Rolled canvas and wood for stretchers leaned against a wall. Past the table stood a second door, which opened to a smaller room with another easel and an old blue-velvet-upholstered armchair. He lowered himself onto the chair, hands on his knees, and looked about him. <br><br>The room was filled with pictures of Camille.<br><br>There was one of her embroidering in the garden with a child at her feet, and another of her reading on the grass with her back against a tree, the sun coming through the leaves onto her pale dress. She was as elusive as light. You tried to grasp it and it moved; you tried to wrap your arms around it and found it gone.<br><br>It had been many years since he had found her in the bookshop. He saw himself then, handsome enough, with a dark beard, dark eyes flickering, swaggering a bit&#x2014;a young man who did not doubt himself for long and yet who under it all was a little shy. The exact words they spoke to each other that day were lost to him; when he tried to remember, they faded. He recalled clearly, though, the breathless tone of her voice, the bones of her lovely neck, and her long fingers, and that she stammered slightly.<br><br>There she stood in his first portrait of her, when she was just nineteen, wearing the green promenade dress with the long train behind her, looking over her shoulder, beautiful, disdainful, as she had appeared nearly half a century before. He rose and lightly touched the canvas. Sometimes he dreamt he held her; that he would turn in bed and she would be there. But she was gone, and he was old. Nearly seventy. Only cool paint met his fingers. &#x201c;Ma tr�s ch�re . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Darkness started to fall, dimming the paintings. He felt the letter in his pocket. &#x201c;I loved you so,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I never would have had it turn out as it did. You were with all of us when we began; you gave us courage. These gardens at Giverny are for you, but I&#x2019;m old and you&#x2019;re forever young and will never see them. I&#x2019;ll write your sister again at her shop in Paris. She must understand; she must know how it was.&#x201d;<br><br>Outside, twilight was falling on the gardens, and the water lilies would be closing for the night. He wiped his eyes and sat for a time to calm himself. Looking around once more, he left the studio and slowly descended the stairs.</p><h2>The Towers of the Sunset (Recluce series, Book 2)</h2><p><p><b>L.E.

Additionally, it forestalled a premature and potentially disastrous cross-channel invasion of France and served as a grueling "testing ground" for an as-yet inexperienced American army. Lastly, by relegating Great Britain to what Atkinson calls the status of "junior partner" in the war effort, North Africa marked the beginning of American geopolitical hegemony. Although his prose is occasionally overwrought, Atkinson's account is a superior one, an agile, well-informed mix of informed strategic overview and intimate battlefield-and-barracks anecdotes. (Tobacco-starved soldiers took to smoking cigarettes made of toilet paper and eucalyptus leaves.) Especially interesting are Atkinson's straightforward accounts of the many "feuds, tiffs and spats" among British and American commanders, politicians, and strategists and his honest assessments of their--and their soldiers'--performance and behavior, for better and for worse. This is an engrossing, extremely accessible account of a grim and too-often overlooked military campaign. <i>--H.

I. Lenin&#x2019;s originality and importance as a revolutionary leader is most often associated with the seizure of power in 1917. But, in this new study and collection of Lenin&#x2019;s original texts, Slavoj i ek argues that his true greatness can be better grasped in the last two years of his political life. Russia had survived foreign invasion, embargo and a terrifying civil war, as well as internal revolts such as the one at Kronstadt in 1921. But the new state was exhausted, isolated and disorientated. As the anticipated world revolution receded into the distance, new paths had to be charted if the Soviet state was to survive.<br><br> With his characteristic brio and provocative insight, i ek suggests that Lenin&#x2019;s courage as a thinker can be found in his willingness to face this reality of retreat unflinchingly. In today&#x2019;s world, characterized by political turbulence, economic crises and geopolitical tensions, we should revisit Lenin&#x2019;s combination of sober lucidity and revolutionary determination.</p></p><p><b>Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek</b> is a Slovenian philosopher and cultural critic.

We balked. How could anyone read the many hundreds of cookbooks published every year, plus all the food magazines and newspaper sections, scan the Internet, and search through all the other surprising places recipes turn up? And even if two of us could, how on earth would we find the best among them?<br> The more we thought about it, though, the more we realized that our fellow home cooks were confronted with the same hopeless task and the very fact that it was so daunting might be the best reason to try. We started to imagine a book we wanted to have ourselves, so we gulped and said yes. And so began our journey into the amazing world of American recipes, where we&#x2019;ve read tens of thousands of them and cooked many thousands in our home kitchens, all in search of the best.<br> From the beginning, we wanted to find recipes that excited our own palates but also brought something else to the party: a new way of looking at a dish, a terrific trick, a solution to a kitchen problem, the ultimate version of a much-beloved classic. We wanted to have a kind of conversation with our readers, telling them what we discovered as we cooked the dish and how to take it in other directions, as well as which steps they could safely shortcut and which ones were absolutely essential. Our goal was to create an up-to- date cookbook for ourselves, full of those keeper dishes we were always meaning to serve again.<br> We knew there were many others who needed the book: time- challenged food lovers with sophisticated palates who can never find the extra hours to cook from all the magazines they get, who can&#x2019;t keep track of the recipes they clip from newspapers, and who have barely enough room on their shelves for another cookbook, but who always always are in the market for good new recipes. We also knew that many men and women needed a book to get them through the holidays, especially Thanksgiving, when most people feel obligated to cook, even if they don&#x2019;t make so much as a baked potato the rest of the year.<br> It didn&#x2019;t take us long to develop a kind of radar for the truly great recipes, the ones we immediately wanted to make again for our friends, forgetting momentarily that we were supposed to be finding still more dishes. Most of the recipes we saw were familiar (some of them filched word for word from other cooks). But now and again a little bell went off in our heads as we encountered something truly new and exciting.<br> We soon learned to our dismay that plenty of recipes that sound great just don&#x2019;t work; testing is key. We never got the big staff that we originally thought it would take to accomplish the project. We made all the dishes ourselves, sometimes with the help of a couple of game family members and the occasional friend. Since we cook in ordinary home kitchens, with regular home stoves and no special restaurant equipment we know how each recipe performs in real life. For starters, if we can&#x2019;t find the ingredients within ten miles of home, we don&#x2019;t make the dish (or we figure out a viable substitution and tell you about it). Since our goal is to be recipe sleuths, not recipe doctors, if the recipe is flawed, we ditch it and move on.<br> Cooking aficionados often say that if you find three good recipes in a book, your money has been well spent. Our first job was to zoom in on those and then sort out which one stood above the rest the most delicious, the most useful for a busy cook, the most unusual for one reason or another. Sometimes we ended up cooking our way through many candidates (often from highly touted cookbooks), without finding anything worth passing along. At other times, it was torture to choose between two or three favorites.<br> Although cookbooks and major magazines are the most obvious sources of new recipes, the real thrills came when we found recipes in obscure places and discovered genius cooks no one had heard of before. Cooking talent is scattered like salt over the whole population. We&#x2019;ve learned of Best recipes from newspaper contests, supermarket flyers, restaurant press releases, and radio and TV shows. More than a few have come from the back of the box. Good recipes really are everywhere. As jaded as we may get after reading thousands and thousands of recipes every year, we&#x2019;re still excited to see a new one. Nothing makes us happier than finding something brilliantly simple that any fool can make without a moment&#x2019;s anxiety a dead-easy, accessible, knock-your-socks off dish that appeals to tenderfoot cooks as well as old hands in the kitchen.<br> As the number of books in this series stacked up, wee often found ourselves calling each other frantically trying to recall in what year a favorite had appeared. Yes, we love all the reeeeecipes in all the books, but inevitably there are some that we turn to again and again. So we got to thinking what if we assembled a Best of the Best and put them together in one grand edition?<br> With nearly 1,000 recipes to choose from, restricting ourselves to an essential 150 was a great deal more difficult than we had imagined. Often we had to stage cook-offs, testing the many turkey recipes or chocolate cakes or chocolate chip cookies to select the best. Just as the series began with a book we wanted to have ourselves, we now have the ultimate resource we need, with the recipes we absolutely can&#x2019;t live without, along with the tips we&#x2019;ve gathered over the years that have changed the way we cook. And we&#x2019;re betting that you, too, will want to make every single one of these recipes again and again.<br><br> Fran McCullough and Molly Stevens <br><br>Copyright � 2006 by Houghton Mifflin Company.

The surprising connection between time and place&nbsp;is explored in&nbsp;<i>Time and Navigation: The Untold Story of Getting from Here to There</i>, the companion book to the National Air and Space Museum exhibition of the same name.<br><br>Today we use smartphones and GPS, but navigating has not always been so easy. The oldest "clock" is Earth itself, and the oldest means of keeping time came from observing changes in the sky. Early mariners like the Vikings accomplished amazing feats of navigation without using clocks at all. Pioneering seafarers in the Age of Exploration used dead reckoning and celestial navigation; later innovations such as sextants and marine chronometers honed these techniques by measuring latitude and longitude. When explorers turned their sights to the skies, they built on what had been learned at sea. For example, Charles Lindbergh used a bubble sextant on his record-breaking flights. World War II led to the development of new flight technologies, notably radio navigation, since celestial navigation was not suited for all-weather military operations. These forms of navigation were extended and enhanced when explorers began guiding spacecraft into space and across the solar system. Astronauts combined celestial navigation technology with radio transmissions. The development of the atomic clock revolutionized space flight because it could measure billionths of a second, thereby allowing mission teams to navigate more accurately. Scientists and engineers applied these technologies to navigation on earth to develop space-based time and navigation services such as GPS that is used every day by people from all walks of life.<br><br>While the history of navigation is one of constant change and innovation, it is also one of remarkable continuity. <i>Time and Navigation</i> tells the story of navigation to help us understand where we have been and how we got there so that we can understand where we are going.</p></p><p>ANDREW K.

If you have ever wondered, 'Just how did they do that?' in reference to navigation, this book (and the exhibits) have you covered. Find out where we started, and marvel at how far we've come<b>.<br><br>LIBRARY JOURNAL</b> <br>This companion to an exhibit of the same name at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum is a slim but impressive volume. Johnston, a geographer at the museum, and curators Roger D. Connor (instruments and avionics), Carlene E. Stephens (timekeeping), and Paul E. Ceruzzi (aerospace electronics and computing) explain that there is a definite but often overlooked link between time and place. Understanding how the two are related has been integral to the evolution of navigation. In material that is articulate and flawlessly logical, the authors show, step by step, how developments in marine navigation gave way to air and then space navigation. In turn, developments in space navigation took the practice from a highly specialized, erudite science to an everyday tool. Presented chronologically, the narrative unfolds as the authors explain how the political, economic, scientific, and military ambitions of a variety of countries and peoples built on one another&#x2014;the 1848 California gold rush had an influence on shipbuilding and the implementation of new sea charts, for example. A feature called &#x201c;Navigation Gone Wrong&#x201d; appears occasionally and highlights failed expeditions throughout history, such as Amelia Earhart&#x2019;s final flight and the destruction of the spacecraft&nbsp;<i>Mariner I</i>. Another occasional feature called &#x201c;Meet the...&#x201d; introduces readers to influential figures such as the teacher Philip Van Horn Weems and the clockmaker William Cranch Bond. Discipline-specific terms such as&nbsp;<i>chronometer</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>astrolabe</i>&nbsp;are defined in-text. The 232 full-color and black-and-white illustrations consist of scores of photos, maps, and drawings.&nbsp;VERDICT&nbsp;Making a complex topic accessible to lay people, this title is a must-have for libraries serving general adult populations.&#x2014;Jennifer Prince, Buncombe Cty. P.L. Syst., NC<br><br><b>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY<br><br></b>Entertaining and packed with information, this collaborative volume from the National Air and Space Museum and the National Museum of American History covers the history of navigation from the days of the astrolabe to global positioning satellites. The emphasis is on the importance of time in establishing position. From the 16th century, European colonizing nations offered prizes to anyone who could invent a clock that would work at sea. The first section describes these various clocks and the development of the ability to chart a course using longitude, which would enable transoceanic sailing. When humans took to the air, they discovered that they needed more exact equipment to find their way, and during WWII the application of radar pushed navigation into the stratosphere. This in turn led to the developments in timekeeping that allowed even more precise navigation to the moon and beyond. The work closes by addressing current means of navigating via smartphone. Copiously illustrated, this book contains fascinating anecdotes as well as a wide range of technical information to complement the stories of those who strove to improve the means of human exploration. (May)<br><br><b>CHOICE</b><br><br>This&nbsp;handsome, oversize volume covers the history of navigation in sea, air, and space, from the sea voyages of the early Chinese, Egyptians, and Scandinavians through the development of modern GPS techniques. &nbsp;Johnston and his three fellow authors (all, National Air and Space Museum) describe the uses and importance of astrolabes, sextants, and other historic instruments.&nbsp; Timekeeping was also vital to ocean navigation, and the book details the difficulties of inventing clocks that would work and keep accurate time at sea.&nbsp; The advent of flying brought new navigating challenges, and tools such as radio navigation systems were developed. &nbsp;Space flight posed yet greater problems for navigators and demanded more precision than ever before, and also led to innovations that improved navigation on earth. &nbsp;The ability to launch satellites into orbit made possible the Global Positioning System, which is today the basis of almost all mapping applications and devices. &nbsp;Profusely illustrated with photographs, maps, charts, and color drawings,&nbsp;<i>Time and Navigation</i>&nbsp;will be&nbsp;excellent for arousing interest in navigation and its history, and for providing basic facts for student reports and projects.<br><i>--A.

He lives in northern California.</p>The Jolly Rogers is the true story of one of the U. S. Navy's foremost World War II fighter squadrons, VF-17, and its charismatic commander , fighter ace Tom Blackburn. The Jolly Rogers is an action packed war memoir and unit history, Blackburn describes VF-17's intense, winning campaign against the Japanese over the northern Solomon Islands and Rabaul in late 1943 and early 1944. Beginning with his own experiences as a trainer of fighter pilots early in World War II and his leadership of a small carrier-based fighter squadron supporting the invasion of North Africa, Blackburn goes on to provide a rich, detailed account of how he shaped a crew of over-eager hotshots into one of the highest scoring fighter squadrons of World War II and U. S. Navy history. In only 76 days of combat, Lieutenant Commander Tom Blackburn's Jolly Rogers knocked down a record of 154 enemy warplanes, and Blackburn himself emerged as one of VF-17's leading aces with eleven aerial combat victories to his credit. The Jolly Rogers is both a valued contribution to military aviation history, and an exciting story that will fascinate the military buff simply in search of a good read. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>15 Seconds: A Novel</h2><p><p>A writer &#x201c;in the company of Child and Coben&#x201d; (<em>Connecticut Post</em>), <em>New York Times</em> bestseller Andrew Gross is the acclaimed author of <em>The Blue Zone</em>, <em>Eyes Wide Open</em>, and other exceptional suspense thrillers.</p><p>With <em>15 Seconds</em>, he delivers an electrifying, lightning-paced story of a desperate man on the run, trying to save his family from the faceless enemy that&#x2019;s determined to destroy them all.

The columns have been collected in </em>Why My Third Husband Will Be a Dog<em> and </em>My Nest Isn&#x2019;t Empty, It Just Has More Closet Space. <p>Voice is the hallmark of a great writer, and I loved John Verdon&#x2019;s riveting <em>Shut Your Eyes Tight</em> from page one, because I fell in love with his voice.</p> <p>Yes, the plot is a humdinger, too, with a bride turning up dead on her wedding day, whereupon former NYPD police detective Dave (&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t call me Davey&#x201d;) Gurney is called out of an uneasy retirement to investigate the crime and find the killer. Gurney&#x2019;s been settling into a country life in the Catskills, trying to force himself to think about mulch and bulldozers, but it ain&#x2019;t working out so great. His superbly-drawn (if realistically tart-tongued) wife is hoping they can spend more time together, but Gurney is a &#x201c;natural-born onion peeler&#x201d; and he can&#x2019;t sit on his hands when murder strikes in nearby, ritzy Tambury.</p> <p>Gurney starts digging, asking thoughtful questions, and interviewing the society types who knew the bride, and soon his dining room table is covered with notes and gruesome crime-scene photos that his wife wishes weren&#x2019;t around when dinner guests arrive. Yet Gurney persists, seeking the truth in his quiet, self-assured way.</p> <p>The plot comes to life on the first page, but as I say, what keeps the pages turning is the pitch-perfect, intriguing voice of this &#x201c;hero,&#x201d; a term I know that Dave Gurney would hate. He&#x2019;s super-smart, but the last one to brag. He loves his wife, but he doesn&#x2019;t get all mawkish about her. He&#x2019;s haunted by the death of his young child, but he doesn&#x2019;t even say that aloud. Even his diversions are fascinating; you&#x2019;ll never forget his theory of &#x201c;The Eureka Fallacy,&#x201d; a lesson in police analysis that applies to your everyday life. And he goes about serving justice, despite all the personal costs at home, with a care and concern that you realize, by the end, is characteristic.</p> <p>I know that you&#x2019;ll want to hear more from Dave Gurney and this amazingly talented author, John Verdon. I can&#x2019;t wait for his next book.</p> <p></p> <strong>A Letter from Author John Verdon</strong> <br> <br> &#x201c;How on earth did you put this together?&#x201d; <p></p> That&#x2019;s probably the question I was asked most frequently about my first Dave Gurney multi-layered thriller, <i>Think of a Number</i>. And now the early readers of the second novel in the series, <i>Shut Your Eyes Tight</i>, an even twistier tale, are asking it again. <p></p> I guess the best way to answer the question is to describe how these complex stories seem to develop in my mind. For me, there are two starting points for every mystery-thriller. There is the largely concealed action of the criminal&#x2014;the true extent and nature of which will drive the plot, creating an increasing level of danger and destruction. And there is a specific mysterious result of that criminal action that initially touches and involves the crime-solver&#x2014;drawing him into an ever higher level of confrontation with the underlying evil enterprise. <p></p> In <i>Think of a Number</i>, the initial tip of the criminal iceberg is a chilling and seemingly clairvoyant series of letters received by Dave Gurney&#x2019;s old college classmate. As other baffling and murderous bits of the iceberg come to the surface, Dave becomes more and more engaged, more personally challenged to find the pattern, the motive, the killer. <p></p> In <i>Shut Your Eyes Tight</i>, the first visible sign of something complex beneath the surface is far more horrific. A bride is decapitated at her own wedding reception&#x2014;and Dave is drawn into the investigation by a disgruntled cop who believes the official investigation is off-track. <p></p> My personal approach is to develop a story like <i>Shut Your Eyes Tight</i> on two simultaneous tracks that gradually become more and more entwined. The criminal does something that gets the attention of the detective; the detective begins his examination of the situation; the criminal escalates his activity, producing results that further involve the detective; the detective&#x2019;s intensified investigative actions provoke more desperate responses by the criminal, building to a climactic high-risk confrontation and the revelation of the full architecture of the very nasty iceberg. <p></p> For me, the key to the credible development of this kind of a narrative lies in understanding my characters&#x2014;their motives, emotions, and potential for interaction. But you know what part of the process excites and inspires me the most? It&#x2019;s the part where I imagine that first visible hint of the monster beneath the surface. Whenever I see a horror or science-fiction movie, the great moment is that first glimpse of trouble. <p></p> I remember an old black-and-white movie I saw, probably back in the 1950s. A happy little family on vacation spent the night in their camping trailer by a back road in the desert. In the morning, one of the children, chasing a ball, comes upon a very strange footprint in the sand&#x2014;nothing recognizably human or animal. <p></p> A clich�d opening? Sure. But it gave me gooseflesh, and I loved it! And of course, there is that remarkable scene near the beginning of David Lynch&#x2019;s <i>Blue Velvet</i>, in which the young hero, walking through the woods, happens upon a human ear. <p></p> I believe that a lot of the power and appeal of any narrative flows from its initial image of trouble. It&#x2019;s the imaginative flash of lightning that illuminates the path into the story&#x2014;for writer and reader alike. <p></p>JOHN VERDON&#x2019;S first novel, <i>Think of a Number, </i>featuring detective protagonist Dave Gurney,<i> </i>was an international bestseller, soaring to the top of bestseller lists in twenty countries.

North, to Canada. &#x201c;Like the slaves,&#x201d; Marion told her sister Celia. They would spend their last days and nights as man and wife as they&#x2019;d spent the first, nearly thirty years ago, in Niagara Falls, as if, across the border, by that fabled and overwrought cauldron of new beginnings, away from any domestic, everyday claims, they might find each other again. Or at least Art hoped so. Marion was just hoping to endure it with some grace and get back home so she could start dealing with the paperwork required to become, for the first time in her life, a single-filing taxpayer.</p><p>They told their daughter Emma they were taking a second honeymoon.</p><p>&#x201c;Plus they&#x2019;re doing another open house here, so...&#x201d; Marion, on the other line, qualified.</p><p>They weren&#x2019;t good liars, they were just afraid of the truth and what it might say about them. They were middle-class, prey to the tyranny of appearances and what they could afford, or dare, which was part of their problem. They were too settled and practical for what they were doing, uncomfortable with desperate measures. They could barely discuss the plan between themselves, as if, exposed to light and air, it might evaporate.</p><p>With Jeremy, it was enough to say they wanted to see the new casino, a Frank Gehry knockoff featured on the covers of Sunday travel sections and in-flight magazines. He was impressed with the rate they&#x2019;d gotten. Art had dug around online to find a bargain.</p><p>&#x201c;Your father the high roller,&#x201d; Marion joked.</p><p>The Valentine&#x2019;s Getaway Special, it was called: $249, inclusive of meals and a stake of fifty Lucky Bucks toward table games.</p><p>They took the bus because it was part of the package, but now, burrowing through a dark wind tunnel of blowing snow somewhere on the outskirts of Buffalo, surrounded by much younger couples&#x2014;including, frozen zoetropically in the light of oncoming cars, a fleshy pair in Harley gear necking directly across the aisle&#x2014;they both wished they&#x2019;d driven.</p><p>They&#x2019;d already made their separate cases at home, so there was no sense going over it again. Art, ever the math major, always bringing matters back to the stingy reality of numbers, had pointed out it would save them fifty dollars in gas, not to mention parking, which Marion thought absurd, and typical. They were so far beyond the stage where fifty dollars might help&#x2014;like this ridiculous gamble, betting their marriage, essentially, on the spin of a wheel&#x2014;yet he clung to his old a-penny-saved-is-a-penny-earned bookkeeping, forgetting the ledger he was tending was drenched in red. Taking the bus represented yet another loss of control, giving themselves up to the hand of fate, or at least a sleep-deprived driver. The only reason she went along with it&#x2014;besides not wanting to fight&#x2014;was that she wouldn&#x2019;t have to worry about Art tailgating people the whole way in this weather, though of course she didn&#x2019;t say that.</p><p>The bus, additionally, was supposed to provide them with cover, as if in gray middle age they weren&#x2019;t invisible enough. From the beginning Art had conceived of the trip as a secret mission, a fantastic last-ditch escape from the snares of their real life, and while Marion refused to believe in the possibility, as at first she&#x2019;d refused to believe the severity of their situation, she also knew they&#x2019;d run out of options. The house had been on the market over a year now without a nibble.

Part of the story is already familiar: Among the paratroopers who landed with the 101st Airborne was the company Stephen Ambrose followed in Band of Brothers. Using firsthand after-action reports and unit journals, Balkoski creates a compelling narrative of the fighting at Utah Beach on D-Day, while meticulously constructed maps pinpoint key geographical features and show unit locations as the action unfolds.</p><p>Added to the invasion plan largely at the insistence of British General Bernard Montgomery, the attack at Utah Beach aimed to secure the Cotentin Peninsula and ultimately seize the port of Cherbourg. Although the assault on Utah Beach became one of the most successful American military operations of World War II, it was fraught with risk from the beginning: Not only was Utah the most isolated of the five D-Day beaches, but the airborne operation was of unprecedented size and scope. Despite the perils, American troops cascaded into that corner of Normandy from the sea and the sky, gaining a military triumph that contributed decisively to Allied success on D-Day. This book is both an engaging narrative and a tribute to the men who stormed the beaches and dropped from the sky.</p></li></p><p>In the early-morning darkness of June 6, 1944, a fleet of U.S. Army Air Force C-47s roared through the skies over Normandy as 13,000 U.S. paratroopers dropped into the marshes and villages behind the beach code-named Utah. A few hours later, American infantrymen--21,000 by day&#x2019;s end--surged out of landing craft and rushed the beach itself. D-Day had begun. <p></p><p>Yet Allied commanders were troubled. The plan for Utah Beach had not even existed four months earlier, having been tacked onto Operation Overlord largely at the insistence of Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower and D-Day ground commander British Gen. Bernard Montgomery. A combined airborne and seaborne invasion of this magnitude had never before been attempted. Many feared that the elite American troops executing the assault would be slaughtered. Not only was Utah the most isolated of the five D-Day beaches--which meant the troops could be cut off for days--but the German defenders had flooded huge tracts of land behind the beach in the airborne drop zones. To move inland, the infantry would have to trudge over a few narrow causeways secured by the paratroopers at the opposite ends. On D-Day, this bold operation would end in either a secure footing on the coast of France, or a bloody repulse back across the English Channel. </p><p></p><p>Success would mark the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany and the liberation of Europe. Failure would paralyze the Allies and prolong the struggle for months, if not years. American troops knew the stakes were high and the perils grave. Nevertheless, from the sea and sky, they confidently cascaded into that far corner of Normandy and contributed decisively to the Allied triumph on D-Day. </p><p></p><p>In <i>Utah Beach: The Amphibious Landing and Airborne Operations on D-Day, June 6, 1944</i>, Joseph Balkoski shows how American soldiers, sailors, and airmen gained that victory in the face of long odds. With the same verve and authority that made his earlier <i>Omaha Beach</i> so compelling, he weaves firsthand accounts, meticulously detailed maps, and dramatic storytelling into the first truly comprehensive narrative of this critical World War II battle. It is indispensable history and unforgettable reading.</p>Joseph Balkoski is Command Historian of the Maryland National Guard and author of <i>Omaha Beach</i> (978-0-8117-3376-2), <i>Utah Beach</i> (978-0-8117-3377-9), and the classic <i>Beyond the Beachhead</i> (978-0-8117-3237-6).

What gave fire to the Gothic tendency in Scottish literature? Why have so many creatively inventive and influential architects been Scots? Where did Scotland's unreal blend of psychotic humor originate? And what about the national tradition of self-deprecation sometimes called the Scottish cringe?</i> While revealing as never before his own vibrant personal history,&nbsp;Connery&nbsp;offers a correction to common&nbsp;misconceptions&nbsp;surrounding Scottish history&nbsp;and offers an intimate, insider's view of the true nature of Scotland.</p><p>Murray Grigor is a Scottish writer and&nbsp;filmmaker.*Starred Review* Sean Connery has three great passions in life: acting, golf, and Scotland. &#x201c;Of the three,&#x201d; he writes, &#x201c;I would put Scotland and Scottish politics first.&#x201d; Neither memoir nor autobiography, his book on his primary passion is wildly ambitious, full of big ideas and gorgeous photographs and a substantial and thoughtful appraisal, to boot. Connery and writer-filmmaker coauthor Grigor touch on virtually all aspects of Scottish history, culture, and politics&#x2014;an endeavor they launch from Connery&#x2019;s own early days in Fountainbridge, the working-class Edinburgh neighborhood in which he grew up, and continue through his big breaks in the theater and on television (playing, for instance, the title role of Macbeth in a Canadian production). They say very little, aside from a few passing remarks, about his illustrious movie career and the role of James Bond. Yet the book is full of quiet, often revelatory surprises, such as about how Connery and his mates were all soccer-crazy and dreamed of one day playing for Scotland, and how his English teacher encouraged his love of words. (And leave it to Connery as Scot, of course, to remind us that America owed its foundation to a Scot, King James VI and I, for whom Jamestown is named.) Anyone who loves Scotland or who has followed Connery&#x2019;s career will enjoy this opinionated and roguish, charming and fascinating book immensely. --June Sawyers</p><h2>Great Mutiny: India 1857</h2><p>&#39;By far the best single-volume description of the mutiny yet written&#39; - &#34;Economist&#34;.

But sometimes the solutions are not as interesting as the beautiful symmetric patterns that lead to them. Written in a friendly style for a general audience, <i>Fearless Symmetry</i> is the first popular math book to discuss these elegant and mysterious patterns and the ingenious techniques mathematicians use to uncover them.</p><br><br><p>Hidden symmetries were first discovered nearly two hundred years ago by French mathematician �variste Galois. They have been used extensively in the oldest and largest branch of mathematics--number theory--for such diverse applications as acoustics, radar, and codes and ciphers. They have also been employed in the study of Fibonacci numbers and to attack well-known problems such as Fermat's Last Theorem, Pythagorean Triples, and the ever-elusive Riemann Hypothesis. Mathematicians are still devising techniques for teasing out these mysterious patterns, and their uses are limited only by the imagination.</p><br><br><p>The first popular book to address representation theory and reciprocity laws, <i>Fearless Symmetry</i> focuses on how mathematicians solve equations and prove theorems. It discusses rules of math and why they are just as important as those in any games one might play. The book starts with basic properties of integers and permutations and reaches current research in number theory. Along the way, it takes delightful historical and philosophical digressions. Required reading for all math buffs, the book will appeal to anyone curious about popular mathematics and its myriad contributions to everyday life.</p></p><p><p>"All too often, abstract mathematics, one of the most beautiful of human intellectual creations, is ground into the dry dust of drills and proofs. Useful, yes; exciting, no. Avner Ash and Robert Gross have done something different--by focusing on the ideas that modern mathematicians actually care about. <i>Fearless Symmetry</i> is a book about detecting hidden patterns, about finding definitions that clarify, about the study of numbers that has entranced some of our great thinkers for thousands of years. It is a book that takes on number theory in a way that a nonmathematician can follow-systematically but without a barrage of technicalities. Ash and Gross are two terrific guides who take the reader, scientist or layman, on a wonderful hike through concepts that matter, culminating in the extraordinary peaks that surround the irresistible, beckoning claim of Fermat's Last Theorem."<b>--Peter Galison, Harvard University</b></p><b>Avner Ash</b> is Professor of Mathematics at Boston College.

She is usually found in South Carolina, where she is either tapping out stories on her computer or completing some kind of historical restoration.<p><b>Chapter One</b></p> <p> <i>Six Months Later</i> </p><p> Lucy Baker shoved her tennis racquet into its case, waved to her tennis partner, and proceeded to jog across the high school field to the track where she would run her daily five miles. A roll of thunder caused her to pick up her feet and sprint. When she reached the track, she tossed her canvas bag onto the bleachers and took off running. </p><p> Tennis, and a five-mile run every day regardless of the weather, had became a routine for her in the six months since she'd stopped practicing law. </p><p> Lucy kept one eye on the threatening thunderclouds overhead and the other on the track. She picked up her speed, not wanting to get caught in a thunderstorm. Off in the distance she could hear hard, rolling thunder, which seemed to be getting closer. One more lap to go. If she pushed it into high gear, she could pass the other runners, who looked like they were dragging. It was always this way on the last lap, she thought smugly. </p><p> She loved passing the muscle boys, shouting out words of encouragement. They were slugs compared to her. In all fairness, not that they needed to know, she'd run track in high school as well as college. She'd hurdled, too. Best on her team. She had the medals to prove it. Of course, they were locked away in one of her trunks. One didn't show off medals. At least she didn't. It was enough for her that she'd earned them, had them, and could look at them anytime she wanted to. Sometimes she needed to remind herself that at one time she'd been the best of the best. </p><p> Her coaches had said she was good enough to go to the Olympics. She had thought so, too. But life got in the way, and she'd had to bow out. She didn't have any regrets. Taking care of her mother during the last two years of her life had been more important than bringing home the gold. </p><p> Lucy whizzed past the bleachers at the south end of the track. She couldn't help but notice two men in dark suits, their arms crossed over their chests. She wondered which one of the guys on the track they were waiting for. </p><p> Sweat dripped down Lucy's face, soaking the tank top she was wearing. Her muscular arms glistened. She was hurting. She'd pushed too hard, too fast on her last lap. "No pain, no gain," she muttered over and over as she flew down the track. She saw the bleachers beckoning her. For one wild moment she thought she was at the wrong end of the track when she saw the two men approaching the north side bleachers. They must have run at her own speed to get there at the exact moment she came to a stop, bent over, with the palms of her sweaty hands on her knees as she took deep breaths. They looked as if they were in great physical shape under their dark suits. She wondered again who they were waiting for. </p><p> When her breathing was almost normal, she walked over to the end of the bleachers away from the men and did leg stretches. Out of the corner of her eye, she could see them approaching her. Lucy looked around to see if anyone was paying attention. Her heart kicked up a beat. This was suburbia, nothing happened in suburbia. </p><p> Lucy was about to reach up to the second row of seats for her gym bag when one of the men handed it to her. "Lucy Baker?" </p><p> "Yes. I'm Lucy Baker." She waited. They could have passed for twins. Frick and Frack. Yin and Yang. </p><p> "Special Agent Harry Conover. This is my partner, Larry Smith." </p><p> "What does that mean? Special agents of what?" She could feel an itch settle between her shoulder blades. </p><p> "We're from the Federal Bureau of Investigation." Two badges were suddenly shoved under her nose. Lucy backed up a half step and reached for the men's credentials. She read them carefully before she handed them back. She waited, her heart thumping inside her chest. </p><p> "We'd like to talk to you for a minute." </p><p> Lucy looked up at the darkening sky. She could still hear the thunder, now directly overhead. It sounded more ominous for some reason. "Why? I haven't done anything wrong. I pay my taxes on time and never cheat. I never even got a parking ticket. It's going to pour in another minute. Like I said, why?" </p><p> "We could sit in our car and talk." </p><p> Lucy snorted. "I-don't-think-so!" No sooner were the words out of her mouth than the sky opened up. Within seconds she was soaked to the skin. "As you can see, I'm already drenched. If you want to get those nice suits all wet, oh, well," she said with false bravado. Why did the FBI want to talk to her? </p><p> The agent named Harry said, "We'd like to talk to you about your fianc�." </p><p> Lucy gaped at the two men. "Jonathan? Why? Oh, God, did something happen to him?" </p><p> "Not yet," Larry said. "We'd like you to tell us about your relationship with Mr. St. Clair." </p><p> Lucy relaxed. The rain was coming down harder. Before long it would be like a waterfall. "I'm going to marry him. We're engaged." She waved her ring finger to show off her three-carat diamond. </p><p> "We already know you're getting married next year, on Valentine's Day. You have your gown. Let's see, you purchased it at Bethany's Bridal Shoppe. They're doing the alterations as we speak. The invitations have been ordered. You're holding the reception at the Ritz-Carlton. I believe there are 250 guests expected. Dinner is a choice of lobster or filet mignon. The salad is an arugula medley. Vegetables are baby carrots, peas from the Emerald Isle, potato-apple fritters, and flaky croissants. Dessert is wedding cake. Cristal champagne will flow endlessly," Agent Smith said, his expression as flat as his tone. </p><p> Lucy didn't like what she was hearing. There was nothing like an FBI check to put the fear of God into a person. There was shock as well as fear in her eyes as she backed up one step, then another. They followed her. </p><p> "A pretty pricey wedding for a girl who graduated at the top of her law school class, quit a thriving criminal law practice, and now makes popcorn balls and sells them through a catalog." </p><p> Well, they had one thing wrong. She wasn't the one who made or sold the popcorn balls. Lucy eyeballed the two agents. "I make an honest living, and I pay my taxes. Listen, I have to go home. It was nice talking with you gentlemen. If you want to talk to Jonathan, call him or go to his apartment. He doesn't leave for work till around nine-thirty when he's in town." She knew for a fact that Jonathan wasn't in town. Let them spin their wheels. </p><p> The agent named Larry wiped the rain from his forehead. "If we wanted to talk to Mr. St. Clair, we would have gone to see him. We know his habits as well as we know yours. Agent Conover and I would like to talk to you." </p><p> "What do you want to talk about? If it's about Jonathan's business, I'm afraid I can't help you. I don't know anything about it." </p><p> It was raining harder now. Since she was already soaked clear through to her skin, what did it matter? "Furthermore, I don't have to talk to you. The last time I checked, this was still a free country. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go home." </p><p> "Miss Baker." It was Agent Conover talking now. "It's imperative you not tell Mr. St. Clair about our meeting this morning. By the way, Jonathan St. Clair is not your fianc�'s real name." </p><p> Lucy whirled around. "What are you talking about? Of course it's his real name. Jonathan is Jonathan. You must have him mixed up with someone else." Overhead, thunder boomed, followed by a streak of jagged lightning ripping across the gray sky. </p><p> "If you talk to your fianc�, it will jeopardize the case we're working on. We can take you into custody if we want to. In order to avoid that, we're asking you to cooperate with us." </p><p> <i>Take me into custody. Jonathan isn't Jonathan. I'm having a nightmare, and I'll wake up any second now.</i> She pinched herself. She felt the pain. </p><p> "All right, I won't say anything to Jonathan. Now can I go?" </p><p> "We'll know if you break your promise, Miss Baker. Do you know what obstructing justice means?" Agent Conover asked. "Of course you do; you're a lawyer." </p><p> "Of course." </p><p> "We'll talk again, Miss Baker." </p><p> "No, Agent Smith, we will not talk again because there is no need for us to talk. I cannot help you with whatever it is you're doing or investigating. I told you I would not say anything to Jonathan, and I won't. That's the end of it." </p><p> "Where was your fianc� born, Miss Baker?" </p><p> "Winchester, Virginia, but then you probably already know that." </p><p> Both agents threw their hands up in the air. They looked like they were catching rain by the handful. "You see, wrong again. Your fianc� was born in Akron, Ohio. Do you want to know his real name?" </p><p> <i>His real name.</i> They were making Jonathan sound like some kind of criminal. Lucy could feel her shoulders start to slump. Her voice could barely be heard over the rumbling thunder. "What is it?" </p><p> "Leo Banks. His friends used to call him Lucky Leo. Does that ring any bells for you, Miss Baker?" Agent Smith asked. </p><p> Lucy looked at both agents. She hoped they would freeze in the rain, just the way she was freezing. They'd just invaded her life and turned it upside down. She thought about the thousands of seed pearls that were being sewn on her wedding gown. The FBI agents had made a mistake. Of course, this was all a mistake. </p><p> "I never heard the name before. I'm telling you, you have the wrong person. Jonathan is not this...this Leo Banks person. I would know. I saw a picture of the house he grew up in. The house is in Winchester, Virginia. I know the street and house number, but I can't think of it right this minute." </p><p> "Were you ever there, Miss Baker?" </p><p> This was all wrong. This shouldn't be happening. But it was. "No, I've never been there." Both agents raised their eyebrows. </p><p> She sounded desperate when she said, "Jonathan is incredibly busy. We just couldn't find the time to get down there. Winchester is a bit of a drive." </p><p> "The house in Winchester belongs to one of Leo's friends." </p><p> <i>It's all a bunch of lies. It has to be all lies.</i> </p><p> "Did you ever meet your fianc�'s parents?" </p><p> "How could I meet them? They live in Spain. If we couldn't find th...</p></p><h2>MOUNT ANALOGUE (Shambhala Pocket Classics)</h2><p>A miniature edition of the internationally acclaimed allegory of man&#39;s search for himself retells the story of a lively expedition of artists and scholars in search of Mount Analogue, an awesome peak that links heaven and earth.</p><p>Rene Daumal (1908-44) was one of the most original thinkers of the twentieth century. A follower of the teachings of G.I. Gurdjieff, he was also a poet, philosopher, and scholar of religion and Sanksrit. In his late-teens his avant-garde poetry was published in leading journals, and barely in his twenties, as a counter to Surrealism and Dadaism, he founded a literary journal Le Grand Jeu. He wrote many essays on religion and philosophy, trained himself in Oriental languages, and engaged in drug experiments to test the limits of the consciousness of the mind, which probably precipitated his death from tuberculosis at age 35. and received the Jacques Doucet prize for his first volume of poetry Le Contre-Ciel. Mount Analogue was first published posthumously, in 1952.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Pied Piper</h2><p>Pied Piper is the gripping story of one elderly man&#39;s daring attempt to rescue a group of children during the Nazi invasion of France. It is the spring of 1940 and John Sidney Howard wants nothing more than to enjoy his fishing holiday in southern France in peace and quiet. However, the Nazi conquest of the Low Countries puts an end to that, and he is asked by friends to take their two children back to England. Crossing France with his young charges seems simple enough at first-until the Germans invade, rendering them fugitives. As Howard struggles to sneak across France, he picks up several more helpless children of various nationalities. They walk for miles in an endless river of refugees, strafed by German planes and hiding in barns at night. By the time Howard and his flock of little ones reach the Channel, his plan of escaping on a fishing boat has become utterly impossible, and in their final confrontation with the invaders, all their lives are at stake.</p><p></p><h2>A Promise of Hope</h2><p>Some children inherit the family nose.

This thinly fictionalized account of Claude Brown's childhood as a hardened, streetwise criminal trying to survive the toughest streets of Harlem has been heralded as the definitive account of everyday life for the first generation of African Americans raised in the Northern ghettos of the 1940s and 1950s. When the book was first published in 1965, it was praised for its realistic portrayal of Harlem -- the children, young people, hardworking parents; the hustlers, drug dealers, prostitutes, and numbers runners; the police; the violence, sex, and humor. The book continues to resonate generations later, not only because of its fierce and dignified anger, not only because the struggles of urban youth are as deeply felt today as they were in Brown's time, but also because the book is affirmative and inspiring. Here is the story about the one who "made it," the boy who kept landing on his feet and became a man.</p><p><b>Claude Brown</b> was born in New York City and grew up in Harlem. At age seventeen, after serving several terms in reform school, he left Harlem for Greenwich Village. He went on to receive a bachelor's degree from Howard University and attended law school. He also wrote a book called <i>The Children of Ham</i> in 1976. <i>Manchild in the Promised Land</i> evolved from an article he published in <i>Dissent</i> magazine during his first year at college. He died in 2002 at the age of 64.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> "Run!" </p><p> Where? </p><p> Oh, hell! Let's get out of here! </p><p> "Turk! Turk! I'm shot?" </p><p> I could hear Turk's voice calling from a far distance, telling me not to go into the fish-and-chips joint. I heard, but I didn't understand. The only thing I knew was that I was going to die. </p><p> I ran. There was a bullet in me trying to take my life, all thirteen years of it. </p><p> I climbed up on the bar yelling, "Walsh, I'm shot. I'm shot." I could feel the blood running down my leg. Walsh, the fellow who operated the fish-and-chips joint, pushed me off-the bar and onto the floor. I couldn't move now, but I was still completely conscious. </p><p> Walsh was saying, "Git outta here, kid. I ain't got no time to play." </p><p> A woman was screaming, mumbling something about the Lord, and saying, "Somebody done shot that poor child." </p><p> Mama ran in. She jumped up and down, screaming like a crazy woman. I began to think about dying. The worst part of dying was thinking about the things and the people that I'd never see again. As I lay there trying to imagine what being dead was like, the policeman who had been trying to control Mama gave up and bent over me. He asked who had shot me. Before I could answer, he was asking me if I could hear him. I told him that I didn't know who had shot me and would he please tell Mama to stop jumping up and down. Every time Mama came down on that shabby floor, the bullet lodged in my stomach felt like a hot poker. </p><p> Another policeman had come in and was struggling to keep the crowd outside. I could see Turk in the front of the crowd. Before the cops came, he asked me if I was going to tell them that he was with me. I never answered. I looked at him and wondered if he saw who shot me. Then his question began to ring in my head: "Sonny, you gonna tell 'em I was with you?" I was bleeding on a dirty floor in a fish-and-chips joint, and Turk was standing there in the doorway hoping that I would die before I could tell the cops that he was with me. Not once did Turk ask me how I felt. </p><p> Hell, yeah, I thought, I'm gonna tell 'em. </p><p> It seemed like hours had passed before the ambulance finally arrived. Mama wanted to go to the hospital with me, but the ambulance attendant said she was too excited. On the way to Harlem Hospital, the cop who was riding with us asked Dad what he had to say. His answer was typical: "I told him about hanging out with those bad-ass boys." The cop was a little surprised. This must be a rookie, I thought. </p><p> The next day, Mama was at my bedside telling me that she had prayed and the Lord had told her that I was going to live. Mama said that many of my friends wanted to donate some blood for me, but the hospital would not accept it from narcotics users. </p><p> This was one of the worst situations I had ever been in. There was a tube in my nose that went all the way to the pit of my stomach. I was being fed intravenously, and there was a drain in my side. Everybody came to visit me, mainly out of curiosity. The girls were ali anxious to know where I had gotten shot. They had heard all kinds of tales about where the bullet struck. The bolder ones wouldn't even bother to ask: they just snatched the cover off me and looked for themselves. In a few days, the word got around that I was in one piece. </p><p> On my fourth day in the hospital, I was awakened by a male nurse at about 3 A.M. When he said hello in a very ladyish voice, I thought that he had come to the wrong bed by mistake. After identifying himself, he told me that he had helped Dr. Freeman save my life. The next thing he said, which I didn't understand, had something to do with the hours he had put in working that day. He went on mumbling something about how tired he was and ended up asking me to rub his back. I had already told him that I was grateful to him for helping the doctor save my life. While I rubbed his back above the beltline, he kept pushing my hand down and saying, "Lower, like you are really grateful to me." I told him that I was sleepy from the needle a nurse had given me. He asked me to pat his behind. After I had done this, he left. </p><p> The next day when the fellows came to visit me, I told them about my early-morning visitor. Dunny said he would like to meet him. Tito joked about being able to get a dose of clap in the hospital. The guy with the tired back never showed up again, so the fellows never got a chance to meet him. Some of them were disappointed. </p><p> After I had been in the hospital for about a week, I was visited by another character. I had noticed a woman visiting one of the patients on the far side of the ward. She was around fifty-five years old, short and fat, and she was wearing old-lady shoes. While I wondered who this woman was, she started across the room in my direction. After she had introduced herself, she told me that she was visiting her son. Her son had been stabbed in the chest with an ice pick by his wife. She said that his left lung had been punctured, but he was doing fine now, and that Jesus was so-o-o good. </p><p> Her name was Mrs. Ganey, and she lived on 145th Street. She said my getting shot when I did "was the work of the Lord." My gang had been stealing sheets and bedspreads off clotheslines for months before I had gotten shot. I asked this godly woman why she thought it was the work of the Lord or Jesus or whoever. She began in a sermonlike tone, saying, "Son, people was gitting tired-a y'all stealing all dey sheets and spreads." She said that on the night that I had gotten shot, she baited her clothesline with two brand-new bedspreads, turned out all the lights in the apartment, and sat at the kitchen window waiting for us to show. </p><p> She waited with a double-barreled shotgun. </p><p> The godly woman said that most of our victims thought that we were winos or dope fiends and that most of them had vowed to kill us. At the end of the sermon, the godly woman said, "Thank the Lord I didn't shoot nobody's child." When the godly woman had finally departed, I thought, Thank the Lord for taking her away from my bed. </p><p> Later on that night, I was feeling a lot of pain and couldn't get to sleep. A nurse who had heard me moaning and groaning came over and gave me a shot of morphine. Less than twenty minutes later, I was deep into a nightmare. </p><p> I was back in the fish-and-chips joint, lying on the floor dying. Only, now I was in more pain than before, and there were dozens of Mamas around me jumping up and screaming. I could feel myself dying in a rising pool of blood. The higher the blood rose the more I died. </p><p> I dreamt about the boy who Rock and big Stoop had thrown off that roof on 149th Street. None of us had stayed around to see him hit the ground, but I just knew that he died in a pool of blood too. I wished that he would stop screaming, and I wished that Mama would stop screaming. I wished they would let me die quietly. </p><p> As the screams began to die out -- Mama's and the boy's -- I began to think about the dilapidated old tenement building that I lived in, the one that still had the words "pussy" and "fuck you" on the walls where I had scribbled them years ago. The one where the super, Mr. Lawson, caught my little brother writing some more. Dad said he was going to kill Pimp for writing on that wall, and the way he was beating Pimp with that ironing cord, I thought he would. Mama was crying, I was crying, and Pimp had been crying for a long time. Mama said that he was too young to be beaten like that. She ran out of the house and came back with a cop, who stopped Dad from beating Pimp. </p><p> I told Pimp not to cry any more, just to wait until I got big: I was going to kill Dad, and he could help me if he wanted to. </p><p> This was the building where Mr. Lawson had killed a man for peeing in the hall. I remembered being afraid to go downstairs the morning after Mr. Lawson had busted that man's head open with a baseball bat. I could still see blood all over the hall. This was the building where somebody was always shooting out the windows in the hall. They were usually shooting at Johnny D., and they usually missed. This was the building that I loved more than anyplace else in the world. The thought that I would never see this building again scared the hell out of me. </p><p> I dreamt about waking up in the middle of the night seven years before and thinking that the Germans or the Japs had come and that the loud noises I heard were bombs falling. Running into Mama's room, I squeezed in between her and Dad at the front window. Thinking that we were watching an air raid, I asked Dad where the sirens were and why the street lights were on. He said, "This ain't no air raid -- just a whole lotta niggers gone fool. And git the hell back in that bed!" I went back to bed, but I couldn't go to sleep. The loud screams in the street and the crashing sound of falling plate-glass windows kept me awake for hours. While I listened to the noise, I imagined bombs falling and people running through the streets screaming. I could see mothers running with babies in their arms, grown men running over women and children to save their own lives, and the Japs stabbing babies with bayonets, just like in the movies. I thought, Boy, I sure wish I was out there. I bet the Stinky brothers are out there. Danny and Butch are probably out there having all the fun in the world. </p><p> The next day, as I was running out of the house without underwear or socks on, I could hear Mama yelling, "Boy, come back here and put a hat or something on your head!" When I reached the stoop, I was knocked back into the hall by a big man carrying a ham under his coat. While I looked up at him, wondering what was going on, he reached down with one hand and snatched me up, still holding the ham under his coat with his other hand. He stood me up against a wall and ran into the hall with his ham. Before I had a chance to move, other men came running through the hall carrying cases of whiskey, sacks of flour, and cartons of cigarettes. Just as I unglued myself from the wall and started out the door for the second time, I was bowled over again. This time by a cop with a gun in his hand. He never stopped, but after he had gone a couple of yards into the hall, I heard him say, "Look out, kid." On the third try, I got out of the building. But I wasn't sure that this was my street. None of the stores had any windows left, and glass was everywhere. It seemed that all the cops in the world were on 145th Street and Eighth Avenue that day. The cops were telling everybody to move on, and everybody was talking about the riot. I went over to a cop and asked him what a riot was. He told me to go on home. The next cop I asked told me that a riot was what had happened the night before. Putting two and two together I decided that a riot was "a whole lotta niggers gone fool." </p><p> I went around the corner to Butch's house. After I convinced him that I was alone, he opened the door. He said that Kid and Danny were in the kitchen. I saw Kid sitting on the floor with his hand stuck way down in a gallon jar of pickled pigs' ears. Danny was cooking some bacon at the stove, and Butch was busy hiding stuff. It looked as though these guys had stolen a whole grocery store. While I joined the feast, they took turns telling me about the riot. Danny and Kid hadn't gone home the night before; they were out following the crowds and looting. </p><p> My only regret was that I had missed the excitement. I said, "Why don't we have another riot tonight? Then Butch and me can get in it." </p><p> Danny said that there were too many cops around to have a riot now. Butch said that they had eaten up all the bread and that he was going to steal some more. I asked if I could come along with him, and he said that I could if I promised to do nothing but watch. I promised, but we both knew that I was lying. </p><p> When we got to the street, Butch said he wanted to go across the street and look at the pawnshop. I tagged along. Like many of the stores where the rioters had been, the pawnshop had been set afire. The firemen had torn down a sidewall getting at the fire. So Butch and I just walked in where the wall used to be. Everything I picked up was broken or burned or both. My feet kept sinking into the wet furs that had been burned and drenched. The whole place smelled of smoke and was as dirty as a Harlem gutter on a rainy day. The cop out front yelled to us to get out of there. He only had to say it once. </p><p> After stopping by the seafood joint and stealing some shrimp and oysters, we went to what was left of Mr. Gordon's grocery store. Butch just walked in, picked up a loaf of bread, and walked out. He told me to come on, but I ignored him and went into the grocery store instead. I picked up two loaves of bread and walked out. When I got outside, a cop looked at me, and I ran into a building and through the backyard to Butch's house. Running through the backyard, I lost all the oysters that I had; when I reached Butch's house, I had only two loaves of bread and two shrimp in my pocket. </p><p> Danny, who was doing most of the cooking, went into the street to steal something to drink. Danny, Butch, and Kid were ten years old, four years older than I. Butch was busy making sandwiches on the floor, and Kid was trying to slice up a loaf of bologna. I had never eaten shrimp, but nobody seemed to care, because they refused to cook it for me. I told Butch that I was going to cook it myself. He said that there was no more lard in the house and that I would need some grease. </p><p> I looked around the house until I came up with some Vaseline hair pomade. I put the shrimp in the frying pan with the hair grease, waited until they had gotten black and were smoking, then took them out and made a sandwich. A few years later, I found out that shrimp were supposed to be shelled before cooking. I ate half of the sandwich and hated shrimp for years afterward. </p><p> The soft hand tapping on my face to wake me up was Jackie's. She and Della had been to a New Year's Eve party. Jackie wanted to come by the hospital and kiss me at midnight. This was the only time in my life that I ever admitted being glad to see Jackie. I asked them about the party, hoping that they would stay and talk to me for a while. I was afraid that if I went back to sleep, I would have another bad dream. </p><p> The next thing I knew, a nurse was waking me up for breakfast. I didn't recall saying good night to Jackie and Della, so I must have fallen asleep while they were talking to me. I thought about Sugar, how nice she was, and how she was a real friend. I knew she wanted to be my girl friend, and I liked her a lot. But what would everybody say if I had a buck-toothed girl friend. I remembered Knoxie asking me how I kissed her. That question led to the first fight I'd had with Knoxie in years. No, I couldn't let Sugar be my girl. It was hard enough having her as a friend. </p><p> The next day, I asked the nurse why she hadn't changed my bed linen, and she said because they were evicting me. I had been in the hospital for eleven days, but I wasn't ready to go home. I left the hospital on January 2 and went to a convalescent home in Valhalla, New York. After I had been there for three weeks, the activity director took me aside and told me that I was going to New York City to see a judge and th...</p></p><h2>NIV, Value Thinline Bible, Large Print, Imitation Leather, Brown</h2><p><p>Lightweight.&nbsp; Versatile.&nbsp; Easy to read.&nbsp;</p><p>This edition of the NIV Bible retains the portability, large print size, and many of the most popular features of the bestselling <em>NIV Thinline Bible, Large Print</em>.

The present edition, heavily edited by &#39;Zadkiel,&#39; was released under the current title in 1852. As the planet Uranus (&#39;Hershel&#39;), discovered in 1781, is mentioned throughout, and Neptune, discovered in 1846, is not, we can bracket the date of composition of the revised edition to the mid-19th century. Horary Astrology, the subject of this book, interprets planetary positions to answer a wide range of questions, from lost dogs and stolen fish, to the death of kings. While there is a basic repertoire of interpretations, (e.g., Saturn bad, Venus good), the horoscope is used as a jumping off point for the astrologer&#39;s intuition. And Lilly apparently had spectacularly good intuition. His famous prediction of the London fire of 1666 was so accurate that he was suspected of starting it, a charge he was later acquitted of. Lilly also used Astrology in medical practice and this book discusses the use of horoscopes in diagnosing diseases, determining whether a patient will die or get better, and so on. Zadkiel was apparently the pseudonym of Richard James Morrison (1795-1874). (Quote from sacred-texts.com) About the Author William Lilly (1602 - 1681) William Lilly (May 1 (O.S.)/May 11 (N.S.), 1602 - June 9, 1681), was a famed English astrologer and occultist during his time. Lilly was particularly adept at interpreting the astrological charts drawn up for horary questions, as this was his speciality. Lilly caused much controversy in 1666 for allegedly predicting the Great Fire of London some 14 years before it happened. For this reason many people believed that he may have had started the fire, but there is --This text refers to an alternate Paperback edition.</p><p>William Lilly (1602 &#x2013; 1681) has been described as "the most abused as well as the most celebrated astrologer of the seventeenth century". Born the son of a yeoman farmer in Leicestershire, Lilly travelled to London as a youth to take up a servant's position. Seven years later he secured his fortune by marrying his former master's widow, allowing him the leisure to study astrology. In 1644, during the English Civil War, he published the first of many popular astrological texts, and in 1647 he published Christian Astrology, a huge compendium of astrological technique. This was the first of its kind to be printed in the English language rather than Latin, and is said to have tutored "a nation in crisis in the language of the stars". By 1659, Lilly's fame was widely acknowledged and his annual almanac was achieving sales of around 30,000 copies a year.</p><h2>Theology of the Body for Teens Parents Guide</h2><p>The Parent's Guide serves as an excellent and informative overview of the Theology of the Body for Teens curriculum.

He captures the heart of the Palestinian experience in image after unforgettable image, with great insight and remarkable humour. The nine-issue comics series won a 1996 American Book Award.

Wells's prophetic imagination was first displayed in pioneering works of science fiction, but later he became an apostle of socialism, science and progress.

But it&#39;s hard to stay engaged with Kipps and the longish descriptions of his problems and feelings. Reader Sam Kelly, however, deserves mostly favorable attention. He varies difficult dialects well, and differentiates among characters, but is occasionally hard to understand. Still, this will satisfy those willing to stay the sometimes tedious course. T.H.

As head coach of the Oakland Raiders, he led his team to victory in Super Bowl XI.

Mr. Madden lives in Pleasanton, California, with his wife, Virginia.Grade 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;This title traces the evolution of professional football from its humble beginnings as an Ivy League-college pastime in the 19th century to one of the most popular spectator sports in the United States. In a somewhat dry narrative, Madden focuses on the development of the game, presenting chronological chapters that introduce significant time periods and identify key players and teams. The text emphasizes rules, prominent athletes, and strategies with sidebars and full-color photographs offering additional information. The author's name recognition through video games and his visibility as a sports commentator will be a natural lure for young readers.

Considered one of the major recent works of philosophy&#39;s reputation enhanced, undoubtedly, by Bertrand Russell&#39;s glowing introduction, this edition is a reproduction of the translation by C.K.

It offers a therapeutic programme bringing the soul and spirituality back into your life, and helps you to look more deeply into emotional problems and sense sacredness in ordinary things - real friends, satisfying conservation, fulfilling work, and experiences that stay in the memory and touch the heart Thomas Moore draws on his own life as a therapist practising &#39;care of the soul&#39;, his studies of the world&#39;s religions, his teaching of Jungian psychology and art therapy, and his work in music and art to create this inspirational guide that examines the connections between spirituality and the problems of individuals and society.</p><p><i>Care of the Soul</i> is considered to be one of the best primers for soul work ever written. Thomas Moore, an internationally renowned theologian and former Catholic monk, offers a philosophy for living that involves accepting our humanity rather than struggling to transcend it. By nurturing the soul in everyday life, Moore shows how to cultivate dignity, peace, and depth of character. For example, in addressing the importance of daily rituals he writes, "Ritual maintains the world's holiness. As in a dream a small object may assume significance, so in a life that is animated by ritual there are no insignificant things." This is the eloquence that helped reintroduce the sacred into everyday language and contemporary values.<strong>Appearing on bestseller lists across the country, this book provides a powerful spiritual uplift for our troubled times.</strong> <p> <i>Care of the Soul </i>offers a completely new way of thinking about daily life-the everyday activities, events, problems and creative opportunities. It proposes a therapeutic lifestyle that focuses on looking more deeply into emotional problems and sensing sacredness in ordinary things. </p><p> Thomas Moore bases his writing on the ancient model of "care of the soul," which provided a religious context for viewing the everyday events of life. Bringing "care of the soul" into the 20th century, he promises to deepen and broaden the reader's perspective on his or her own life experiences. Moore draws on his own life as a therapist practicing "care of the soul," as well as his studies of the world's religions and his work in music and art, to create this inspirational guide that examines the connections between spirituality and the problems of individuals and society.</p></p><h2>Bible Answers for Every Need (Inspirational Book Bargains)</h2><p>For God's perspective on any number of issues, the topically arranged scriptures in Bible Answers for Every Need are an indispensable help.

Christopher Lloyd's vivid biography paints a memorable portrait of the leader, inventor, and reformer whose courageous actions inspired the works of Frederick Marryat, C. S. Forester, and Patrick O'Brian.<br></p><p>Thomas Cochrane (1775-1860), the 10th Earl of Dundonald, was a man distinctly of his time, and in some ways far in advance of it. Descended from a noble Scottish family that had fallen on hard times, Cochrane had a naval career spanning the Napoleonic wars and beyond, to the struggles for independence of Chile, Peru, Brazil, and Greece. His exploits showed such tactical genius that they have become textbook examples in military training, and his derring-do inspired the lives and fiction of Frederick Marryat (who sailed with Cochrane as a young man), C.S. Forester, and Joseph Conrad.<p> But Cochrane's career was a checkered one, due mostly to his dislike of authority and tendency to nurse grudges. The man whose meticulous naval strategies were masterpieces of preparation was prone to ill-considered attacks on those in command, and his career as a British naval officer came to an effective end when he prosecuted a court martial against his commanding officer Lord Gambier after his near-disastrous timidity at the Battle in the Aix Roads. His political career as a radical politician was similarly jeopardized by impulsive attacks against the sitting government, and while he had a series of stunning military victories later in life as the admiral of several South American navies, each was followed by political wrangling and disappointment.</p><p> Christopher Lloyd's popular biography (first published in 1947) is as brisk and engaging as the novels that Cochrane inspired. It is a well-balanced portrayal of a man who, despite his heroism, invention (he proposed poison gas as a weapon a full hundred years before its usage), and idealistic commitment to liberal causes, was never given the opportunity to achieve his true genius. <i>--John Longenbaugh</i></p>Christopher Lloyd (1906-1986), one of Britain's premier naval historians, taught at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, and the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, from 1934 to 1966.<br></p><h2>Legends: Outstanding Quarter Horse Stallions and Mares (Volume 1)</h2><p>Features articles about legendary Quarter Horse stallions and mares who gained fame in the early days of the AQHA, or who had a profound effect on the breed. <br></p><p>Many great horses have played key roles in the Quarter Horse breed, and this book profiles some of the early day legends - mostly stallions, but also a few mares.

From a father's perspective and with his unique sense of humor, Cosby discusses the decision to have a child, the changes the child brings about, and the issues of discipline and independence. By making parents laugh at the pitfalls of parenthood, he shows them in his fresh and funny way that even at their moments of greatest frustration they are not alone. Harvard psychiatrist Poussaint's introduction and lengthy afterword, in which he discusses the changing role of the modern father, add greatly to the book's value as a parenting guide. By using actual letters children have written to her and weaving them together with personal anecdotes, Blume allows children to express their innermost feelings. She is thereby able to reveal children's fears about growing up, popularity, sexuality, and death and their experiences with such serious problems as drug abuse, incest, and life in foster care. While her book will give guidance to parents trying to understand their children (there is a list of agencies, as well), it will also appeal to young adults trying to understand themselves. Although neither book gives in-depth treatment to any topic, both are sure to have wide readership. Recommended for public libraries. Florence Scarinci, Nassau Community Coll.

The end of work as we know it will hit at the worst moment imaginable: as capitalism fosters permanent stagnation, when the labor market is in decrepit shape, with declining wages, expanding poverty, and scorching inequality. Only the dramatic democratization of our economy can address the existential challenges we now face. Yet, the US political process is so dominated by billionaires and corporate special interests, by corruption and monopoly, that it stymies not just democracy but progress.<br><br>The great challenge of these times is to ensure that the tremendous benefits of technological progress are employed to serve the whole of humanity, rather than to enrich the wealthy few. Robert W. McChesney and John Nichols argue that the United States needs a new economy in which revolutionary technologies are applied to effectively address environmental and social problems and used to rejuvenate and extend democratic institutions. Based on intense reporting, rich historical analysis, and deep understanding of the technological and social changes that are unfolding, they propose a bold strategy for democratizing our digital destiny before it's too late&#x2014;and unleashing the real power of the Internet, and of humanity.</p><p><b>John Nichols</b>, a pioneering political blogger, has written <i>The Nation</i>'s Online Beat since 1999, is their Washington, DC, correspondent, and is a contributing writer for <i>The Progressive</i> and <i>In These Times</i>.

Written with the designer&#x2019;s cooperation and access to his personal archives, Armani&#x2019;s story is accurately rendered, from his modest beginnings and early home environment to the influences and colleagues who helped build his name. Yet ultimately, this is the story of a man with an innate sense of style and unmatched entrepreneurial strategy, both of which allowed him to create a new way of thinking an aesthetic genre that went beyond a world of appearance and clothing that single-handedly changed the face of fashion forever.</p></p><p><p><b>Renata Molho</b> is a fashion critic for the daily financial newspaper <i>Il Sole 24 Ore</i>, and a former contributor to many publications of the Cond� Nast group, including the Italian editions of <i>GQ</i> and <i>Vogue</i>.</p>Before he became an icon, fashion designer Georgio Armani grew up in a middle-class family and studied medicine, falling into fashion largely by chance: "In my beginnings, there was no fire in the belly for fashion. I really didn't want to do fashion at all," he says. In this honest, insightful biography, Italian fashion critic (and former contributor to Italian GQ and Vogue) Molho follows Armani from his childhood in Piacenza, Italy during WWII, through his induction into the industry, the challenges of establishing Emperio Armani S.p.A. in 1975, to ultimate success and fame. Although Armani's accomplishments bring him a luxury lifestyle, his early years are wrenching, as is the 1985 death of his beloved partner, Sergio Galeotti, a loss that nearly took him back to square one. Throughout, Molho poignantly illustrates the balance between Armani's obsession with work (where he's a self-described "tyrant") and his private life as a kind, introverted man who wishes he were less shy. Molho may leave readers wanting more personal details, but the glimpses he digs up are telling, as in Armani's open exchange with Eric Clapton from a 1995 GQ interview. 64 pages color photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

To any Greek, the Celts were just another race of distant barbarians. Traders might bring back stories of them, and occasionally a small group of Celtic warriors might appear among the mercenaries of a hired army, but they were no threat to civilized Greek folk going about their daily business. <br><br> Sometime during his early years in Rhodes, a daring notion first entered the mind of Posidonius. He had been taught by his Stoic professors that the world and all its people were part of a divine order. What better way to understand this order than a great journey of exploration? He knew that tribes still relatively uncorrupted by civilizing influences would be an important part of such a study. To be sure, this grand excursion would be the perfect opportunity to explore other subjects- astronomy, geology, and oceanography just to name a few- as well, but it was unspoiled human culture he most wanted to examine...The best possibility lay in the last place any reasonable Greek philosopher would want to go. In the distant west, beyond even the rule of Rome, lay the unknown land of the Celts.</p><p><b>Philip Freeman</b> is Qualley Professor of Classics at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, and a former professor of classics at Washington University in St. Louis.

Visit him at PhilipFreemanBooks.com.Sometime during the first century B.C., the Greek Stoic philosopher Posidonius traveled north and west to see for himself the mysterious culture of the Celts, which he had read about in Herodotus, Plato and Aristotle. Although none of Posidonius' writings survive, Freeman, a professor of classics (<i>St. Patrick of Ireland</i>), sketchily recreates the philosopher's world out of the fragmentary writings of Polybius, Strabo and Caesar, using the philosopher's journey as a flimsy excuse to draw on his own noted expertise in Celtic history and culture. The speculative observations about Posidonius fill only two to three pages of each chapter; the bulk of the book records information about the ancient Celts that readers can find elsewhere, including in Freeman's earlier books. For example, we learn that Celtic feasts were often boasting contests between two tribes and that the Celts were fierce warriors who engaged in one-on-one combat, headhunters and religious people whose priests, the Druids, viewed the natural world as sacred. Posidonius was neither the first to discover all this nor the first to write about it for Hellenistic culture, and Freeman's bewildering book reveals little new on the subject. 8 pages of b&amp;w illus. not seen by <i>PW</i>, 2 maps. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After studying French literature at Tokyo University, he won his first literary award-the coveted Akutagawa Prize-for a short story, "The Catch." A writer committed to both literary and humanitarian causes, his output has included (in English) <em>A Personal Matter</em>, <em>The Silent Cry</em>, <em>Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness</em>, <em>The Pinch Runner Memorandum</em>, and <em>Nip the Buds</em>, <em>Kill the Kids</em>. These and other works of his have been widely translated, not only in Europe and Russia but in several Asian countries. <br><br>Oe, who won the Nobel Prize in 1994, lives in Tokyo with his wife and three children. <br><br>The translator, JOHN BESTER, is one of the foremost translators of Japanese fiction. In 1990 he received the first Noma Translation Award for his English version of a short-story collection by Yukio Mishima entitled <em>Acts of Worship</em>.<br>"Why don't you try some water instead?" I urged her. "There's a spring here that the valley folk say gives the best water in the whole forest. That's if it hasn't dried up." <p>It hadn't dried up. At the foot of the slope on the forest side of the road, an unexpected outflow of water formed a pool about as big as the circle of a man's arms. The water--too copious, almost, to have sprung from such small beginnings--made a channel that ran down to the valley. Beside the pool stood a number of outdoor hearths, some new, some old, the clay and stones charred black and hideous inside. In my childhood, my friends and I had built just such a hearth by the spring, and cooked rice and made soup there. In a twice-yearly ritual, each of us chose the group he would camp out with, thereby determining the division of forces among the children of the valley. The outing lasted only two days each spring and autumn, but the influence of the groups thus formed by the children remained valid throughout the year. Nothing was so humiliating as to be expelled from the group one had joined. </p><p>As I bent down over the spring to drink from it directly, I had a sudden sense of certainty: certainty that everything--the small round pebbles, grayish blue and vermilion and white, lying at the bottom of water whose brightness seemed still to harbor the midday light; the fine sand that swirled upward, clouding it ever so slightly; and the faint shiver that ran over the surface of the water--was just as I'd seen it twenty years before; a certainty, born of longing yet to myself, at least, utterly convincing, that the water now welling up so ceaselessly was exactly the same water that had welled up and flowed away in those days. And the same certainty developed directly into a feeling that the "I" bending down there now was not the child who had once bent his bare knees there, that there was no continuity, no consistency between the two "I's," that the "I" now bending down there was a remote stranger. The present "I" had lost all true identity. Nothing, either within me or without, offered any hope of recovery. </p><p>I could hear the transparent ripples on the pool tinkling, accusing me of being no better than a rat. I shut my eyes and sucked up the cold water. My gums shrank, leaving a taste of blood on my tongue. As I stood up, my wife bent down in obedient imitation, as though I was an authority on how to drink from the spring. In fact, I was as complete a stranger to the spring by now as she, who had just come through the forest for the first time. I shuddered. The bitter cold penetrated my consciousness again. Shivering, my wife stood up too and tried to smile to show that the water had tasted good; but her teeth as her purple lips shrank back merely seemed to be bared in anger. Shoulder to shoulder, silent and shuddering with cold, we returned to the jeep. Takashi averted his eyes as though he'd seen something too pitiful to look on.</p></p><h2>Mars, Book 13</h2><p>A bad boy can change a good girl forever. Rei is the school delinquent.

Many can say that about Dan&#x2019;s whole life. In <i>His Ownself</i>, we follow him from his youth in Texas, where being a sports fan meant understanding a lot about religion, heroes, and drinking; to his first job at the <i>Fort Worth Press</i> working alongside all-time journalistic greats like Blackie Sherrod and Bud Shrake; to the glory days of <i>Sports Illustrated</i>. One of a handful of writers to establish <i>SI</i> as the most important sports magazine ever, Dan refocused the magazine&#x2019;s college football coverage and covered the game&#x2019;s greatest players and coaches. Beyond football, Dan is in the conversation about the best golf writers of all time. Having covered every Masters, U.S. Open, PGA, and British Open for the past fifty years, he takes us behind the scenes to capture the drama&#x2014;as well as the humor&#x2014;of these tournaments as he brings us up close and personal with the likes of Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From his friendship and the rounds played with Ben Hogan, to the stories swapped with New York&#x2019;s elite, to the corporate expense accounts abused, Dan lets loose on his experiences in journalism, sports, and showbiz. An honest, one-of-a-kind look at politics, hypocrites, political correctness, the past, the present, Hollywood, money, and athletes, this is a sports fan&#x2019;s dream book. It&#x2019;s a touching, laugh-out-loud tribute to the romanticism of sportswriting and the glory days of sports, told straight from the mouth of the man who saw it all his ownself.</p><p>Dan Jenkins is one of America's most acclaimed sportswriters as well as a bestselling novelist. A native Texan, he has spent a lifetime at the typewriter and computer. He might best be known for his twenty-four years of stories in <i>Sports Illustrated</i> and now <i>Golf Digest</i>. Three of his bestselling novels, <i>Semi-Tough</i>, <i>Dead Solid Perfect</i>, and <i>Baja Oklahoma</i>, were made into movies. His sportswriting has won him many awards. In 2012 he was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame&#x2014;one of only three writers to be honored thus far&#x2014;and was given the PEN Lifetime Achievement Award for Literary Sports Writing. He is also the 2013 winner of the Red Smith Award, the highest honor in his profession.Chapter 1<br><br>The Fine Art of Sitting Around and Hanging Out<br><br>It seems to me that in my busiest years of writing for a living, I spent most of my free time in convivial bars. I didn&#x2019;t seek out the bars so much for the whiskey as I did for the atmosphere. A decent bar was a place where I could sip a cocktail, smoke a cigarette, have engrossing conversations with friends, and if there was music at all it was a jukebox with Sinatra and Judy and others on it with a regard for melody--in contrast to today&#x2019;s eruptions of Krakatoa. I could sit in comfort and eventually reach for a cheese stick or a deviled egg. Dinner at last.<br><br>There were a lot of bars like that. They were easy to find after I&#x2019;d licked another deadline for--in order of my employment--the Fort Worth Press, Dallas Times Herald, Sports Illustrated, Playboy, and Golf Digest.<br><br>Hotels provided such hangouts. Downtowns offered them. Neighborhoods had them. They provided a calmness and sanity to life, travel, deadlines, and those occasions when an editor might mistake a machete for a pencil.<br><br>Truthfully, I can say that in sixty-five years of covering sports and sidelining as a book author, my stuff hasn&#x2019;t been raped and plundered too much. There were a few times at Sports Illustrated in the New York days when I&#x2019;d feel that my stuff suffered cruel and unusual punishment. If an editor, for example, would insert &#x201c;faster than a speeding bullet&#x201d; in my copy, I&#x2019;d resist the urge to throw his pot plant overboard. Instead, I&#x2019;d take out my revenge by staying in another luxury hotel on the road.<br><br>Say it was the Beverly Hills. I&#x2019;d reserve a cabana by the pool, relax over a cocktail, have a McCarthy Salad, and watch the fat music mogul in thongs and dark glasses yell at people on the phone.<br><br>Those were the days when it was almost impossible to abuse an SI expense account because the magazine was wallowing in coin. It enabled me to avoid discomfort and inconvenience.<br>It was in a bar that I reconnected with the incomparable June Burrage, girl of my dreams since high school. The bar in Fort Worth was the Key Club in the Western Hills Hotel, and we dined later in the Branding Room. We were both between pictures.<br><br>After dinner I took out my gold Dunhill, lit her cigarette, stared into her eyes, and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got Texas with nine and a half over Syracuse in the Cotton Bowl--what do you think?&#x201d;<br><br>She said, &#x201c;Can I go?&#x201d;<br><br>We should have married years earlier, but life got in the way. I made two earlier mistakes in the marriage game.<br><br>My first was Pattie, the high school girlfriend. We were married for, oh, thirty minutes, maybe forty-five. Just long enough for both of us to realize it was financially irresponsible.<br><br>The second was less of a marriage than two people finding themselves trapped in an Edward Albee play. Joan was a young English professor at TCU and she happened to come from a wealthy family, which made her twice as smart as me.<br><br>Both divorces were almost the same thing as affable. No kids or money involved. Each split fell into the category of You Take the Books, I&#x2019;ll Take the Records.<br><br>Flashback. It&#x2019;s 1997 at the Ryder Cup in Valderrama, Spain. I was in the press lounge, which could pass for a bar, when I was told that a lady from America was at the door and wanted to say hello. I went out and found a slender woman in dark glasses and graying hair.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Do we know each other?&#x201d;<br><br>She said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Joan, you asshole.&#x201d;<br><br>Christ, I hadn&#x2019;t seen her in forty years.<br><br>I said, &#x201c;It is you! What are you doing here? You used to hate golf. You used to throw clock radios at golf.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nice seeing you, too,&#x201d; she smiled.<br><br>We laughed and visited for twenty minutes about life itself, then she went back to Austin, Texas, and I went back to acting interested in Spain.<br><br>June married at nineteen in her folly of youth, and it didn&#x2019;t last for whatever reason, or reasons, some marriages don&#x2019;t last.<br><br>The fact is, I&#x2019;ve been the luckiest sumbitch ever allowed to make a living as a writer. Luckier still that June and I found each other. We&#x2019;ve produced three wonderful kids--Sally, Marty, and Danny. We enjoy great friends from high school, college, journalism, and sports. We&#x2019;re still laughing and loving our way through life after fifty-four years together.<br><br>It&#x2019;s hardly news that there&#x2019;s trouble, strife, and entanglements in everybody&#x2019;s life. But when messy things happen, I tend to fall back on the words of Billy Clyde Puckett.<br><br>Billy Clyde didn&#x2019;t go to Harvard, but he was still deep enough to say: &#x201c;Laughter is the only thing that cuts trouble down to a size where you can talk to it.&#x201d;<br>My down time was more satisfying in civilized bars. A civilized bar is where it was discovered that the problem with sitting around is you never know when it&#x2019;s over.<br><br>Part of the appeal is that cynical wit exists in civilized bars where writers gather. As do suggestions on how editors with tin ears and blue pencils can be captured and put in straitjackets for making stories look like squirrels have been nibbling on them.<br><br>Incidentally, I have to say that bars looked more civilized before so many sportswriters began wearing shorts and sneakers. Today you can find dozens of them armed with bottles of funny-colored health drinks. Things that could pass for A-Rod&#x2019;s specimen.<br><br>Among them, there&#x2019;s always one who will take it to DEFCON 2 if anybody lights up a Marlboro.<br><br>Many are friends and while I&#x2019;m pleased to see them looking fit and comfortably attired, it&#x2019;s not easy to envision the old heroes of my trade--John Lardner, Red Smith, Damon Runyon--walking around in public in shorts and sneakers.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a severe challenge today to find a bar that&#x2019;s not a war zone, even if I only want one Junior and water at this stage of my development. Granted, I used to require twenty to become witty and charming, or rich and powerful, or to make other people interesting.<br><br>The mindless din in a bar today renders it next to impossible to chat about worldly things. Like, you know, exactly how many Kardashians are there? Is Sean Penn still grieving over Che Guevara&#x2019;s execution? And how many NFL players will be tackled by their hair this season?<br><br>As for the music, melody has been replaced by something that brings to mind dueling leaf blowers, with lyrics written for juvenile delinquents.<br><br>A while back I was moved to raise my voice as I sat alone at the breakfast table. In the paper I came across this review of a rapper named Mucus something. I could have the name wrong. The critic wrote:<br><br>&#x201c;A richly textured effort. The lyrics slip past in an elliptical blur. Heartbreak drifts to the surface, leaving only the beautifully conceived sound-scapes catapulting into staggering new dimensions.&#x201d;<br><br>To nobody I shouted, &#x201c;Jesus H. God! It&#x2019;s not Irving Berlin, you pathetic moron!&#x201d;<br><br>In most bars these days even a hold-it is part of the din. Yelling, chirping, screeching. Except she&#x2019;s not a hold-it anymore. Or a stove (over forty), a stovette (under forty), or a chick, a babe, or a shapely adorable. She&#x2019;s a young hotness.<br><br>&#x201c;I note a deluge of young hotness in here tonight,&#x201d; I overheard a young man say shortly after the twenty-first century arrived.<br><br>In my day a young hotness was Debbie Reynolds in Singin&#x2019; in the Rain. A mature hotness was Cyd Charisse in Singin&#x2019; in the Rain. Today in my opinion a young hotness suffers from sundry defects. A ring in her nose, a zircon in her eyebrow, a diamond on her tongue, a safety pin in her navel, and a dragon on her back.<br><br>Up on the walls there are these TV announcers howling with their unbridled enthusiasm about nothing. Tiger Woods has made a two-foot putt. Tiger Woods has pumped his fist. Tiger Woods has finished 43rd in the tournament but will take away a lot of positives from the experience.<br><br>I recall a night in one of these places where a stranger tried to have a conversation with me at the peak of the din.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;You headed to the British?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What fish?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I said British . . . the Open.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hate Oakland.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s at Birkdale.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your birthday?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I liked your story on the Masters.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You ask her--I think she&#x2019;s with someone.&#x201d;<br><br>In this age there are bars I avoid with the same nimble footwork that enables me to avoid fish tacos and kangaroo nachos.<br><br>I give you the arena where eight or more NFL games glisten on the TV screens as hordes of intellectuals in Dallas Cowboy jerseys or with blocks of cheese on their heads do fist bumps to celebrate an incomplete pass.<br><br>Then there&#x2019;s the rock-cafe emporium. Among the artifacts on the walls are a framed tooth that fell out of Mick Jagger&#x2019;s mouth when he turned 106 years old, a jar of Vaseline Jim Morrison autographed for Janis Joplin, and the leg of a corpse left over from a Led Zeppelin concert.<br><br>So what is a decent bar, you may ask?<br><br>To start, it&#x2019;s not political. If you grow loud discussing the issues that divide us today, you have to go outside and stand in the blizzard with the smokers.<br><br>I frequently discussed politics with Bud Shrake, one of my oldest friends and a fellow writer--he the Communist infiltrator, me the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy--but we never got angry. As Bud explained to his liberal Austin friends, &#x201c;If it gets serious, we settle it at Ping-Pong.&#x201d;<br><br>A decent bar becomes a personal clubhouse. Many of the customers are friends. If there&#x2019;s music, it&#x2019;s tuneful. If there&#x2019;s no Sinatra or Judy on the jukebox, there are the anthems of Willie and Kris and Patsy. Which was when country music peaked. The writer Allison Glock summed up today&#x2019;s country in a piece in the New York Times. &#x201c;Pop in cowboy hats,&#x201d; she called it. Damn, I wish I&#x2019;d said that.<br><br>My personal clubhouse has good, simple food at all hours. The all-day breakfast is available. You&#x2019;ll never find quail eggs, avocado, or fois gras on the cheeseburgers. The place isn&#x2019;t fancy. Clean and comfortable does it. The lighting is right. Not too dark, not too bright, just sort of golden. Lighting that in my younger days made the occasional lady look like Barbara Jane Bookman and me look Witty and Charming, Part II.<br>In the SI days when I was traveling constantly, there were special haunts that required my presence as soon as the plane landed, my ankles had been taped, and I&#x2019;d rubbed on the eye black.<br><br>Club XIX in the Pebble Beach Lodge was one. It was from the same stool at the end of the bar in Club XIX that I covered four U.S. Opens, a PGA Championship, and twelve Crosby tournaments.<br><br>In the evenings the place would be awash with movie stars, golfing heroes, sports immortals. A man could sit there and watch it all come and go, including a variety of tricky ladies, some of whom were even wives. The time in there deserved the name I gave it.<br><br>I blurted it out one night in a moment of brilliance. It was when James Garner pushed into my corner to order an after-dinner beverage, and said, &#x201c;Why am I not surprised you&#x2019;re still here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m waiting for Lana Turner,&#x201d; I said. It stuck with friends.<br><br>Garner said, &#x201c;I think I saw three earlier.&#x201d;<br><br>Another place that demanded my presence was the Polo Lounge in the Beverly Hills Hotel. I got there too late for Clark Gable, Marlene Dietrich, Will Rogers, and Jean Harlow, but the Polo Lounge was--and still is--a historic landmark for sitting around.<br><br>I would stay at &#x201c;the Hills&#x201d; when I&#x2019;d go to L.A. for USC football games, UCLA football games, Ram games, Rose Bowls, Super Bowls, L.A. Opens, book tours, or urgent Hollywood confabs and pow-wows.<br><br>I would establish headquarters in the Polo Lounge. The use of a handy money clip earned me the devoted friendship of the three gentlemen who ran the room in those years--Dino, Walter, and Nino.<br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t guess how much whip-out it took for me to progress from &#x201c;Good evening, Mr. Jessup&#x201d; to &#x201c;Good evening, Mr. Jamson&#x201d; to &#x201c;Ah, Mr. Jenkins, right this way.&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;d be led to one of the front booths on the left, dark green and cushiony. The guacamole, cheese dip, and chips would appear, and a plug-in phone--like I might need to return Paul Newman&#x2019;s call.<br>Back in Manhattan, home for thirty years, I&#x2019;d settle into Elaine&#x2019;s, P. J. Clarke&#x2019;s, and Toots Shor&#x2019;s to relax and enjoy doing three of my favorite off-duty things--smoking, drinking, not giving a shit.<br><br>I called it &#x201c;sailing to Europe&#x201d; if I devoted a full evening to Elaine&#x2019;s, and found myself ordering backups for total strangers who&#x2019;d joined my table. The check could equal the passage on an ocean liner to Cherbourg.<br><br>I relied on character and conditioning to see me through such nights.<br><br>Elaine was sitting with June and me and Mike Lupica of the Daily News the night she made the remark that was widely quoted in her obits. A first-time customer leaned in to ask her where the men&#x2019;s room was. She glanced down at the opposite end of the room, and said:<br><br>&#x201c;Uh . . . go to Michael Caine and take a right.&#x201d;<br><br>In a joint where celebs were part of the woodwork, I took a celeb to Elaine&#x2019;s on occasion. A Darrell Royal, a Jack Nicklaus. But my major celeb was David Merrick, the biggest Broadway tycoon in the days when Broadway was Broadway. We became friends when he bought Semi-Tough for the movies.<br><br>My wife and I often dined at Elaine&#x2019;s with Merrick, and with his associate Allen DeLynn. Allen was a walking book of theater, Hollywood, and sports anecdotes.<br><br>It&#x2019;s been written that Merrick was &#x201c;feared by many, liked by few, but never disregarded.&#x201d; I have to say he was wonderful to us and our kids. He wanted to pay Sally&#x2019;s tuition when she was accepted at Stanford. It made June cry.<br><br>I said, &#x201c;David, it&#x2019;ll be easier on my money clip if I handle the tuition. You can get the car, drugs, guns, and pizza.&#x201d;<br><br>It surprised me to discover that Merrick was a big sports fan. I got him a press credential and took him along when I covered the U.S. Open in 1980 at Baltusrol in New Jersey. I found a moment around the putting green to introduce him to Jack Nicklaus. He&#x2019;d wanted to meet Jack, a fellow icon.</p><h2>Remembering poets: Reminiscences and opinions : Dylan Thomas, Robert Frost, T. S.

The event was a spectacular success, attracting seventy exhibitors and nearly fifty thousand visitors. Among the spectators was&nbsp; an obscure would-be automaker named Henry Ford, who walked the floor speaking with designers and engineers, trying to gauge public enthusiasm for what was then a revolutionary invention. His conclusion: the automobile was going to be a fixture in American society, both in the city and on the farm&#x2014;and would make some people very rich. None, he decided, more than he.<br><br> <i>Drive!</i> is the most complete account to date of the wild early days of the auto age. Lawrence Goldstone tells the fascinating story of how the internal combustion engine, a &#x201c;theory looking for an application,&#x201d; evolved into an innovation that would change history. Debunking many long-held myths along the way, <i>Drive!</i> shows that the creation of the automobile was not the work of one man, but very much a global effort. Long before anyone had heard of Henry Ford, men with names like Benz, Peugeot, Renault, and Daimler were building and marketing&nbsp; the world&#x2019;s first cars.<br><br> Goldstone breathes life into an extraordinary cast of characters: the inventors and engineers who crafted engines small enough to use on a &#x201c;horseless carriage&#x201d;; the financiers who risked everything for their visions; the first racers&#x2014;daredevils who pushed rickety, untested vehicles to their limits; and such visionary lawyers as George Selden, who fought for and won the first patent for the gasoline-powered automobile. Lurking around every corner is Henry Ford, a brilliant innovator and an even better marketer, a tireless promoter of his products&#x2014;and of himself. <br><br> With a narrative as propulsive as its subject, <i>Drive! </i>plunges us headlong into a time unlike any in history, when near-manic innovation, competition, and consumerist zeal coalesced to change the way the world moved.<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Drive!</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] marvelously told story . . . The author provides a terrific backdrop to the &#x2018;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&#x2019; era in which his story takes place.

Men such as Newton, Leibniz, Robert Hooke, Descartes, and Robert Boyle were all renowned for discoveries or innovations in a variety of disciplines. Christiaan Huygens was another of that century&#x2019;s masters. An advisor to France&#x2019;s Louis XIV for fifteen years, Huygens is best known for his work in astronomy, optics, and timekeeping&#x2014;�he discovered Saturn&#x2019;s moon Titan, and invented what came to be called the grandfather clock. But like most of his contemporaries, he was drawn to the more conceptual problems of the day, working in the mind as much as in practical spheres, theorizing on such diverse topics as the force of gravity and probability in games of chance.<br><br>One possibility that fascinated him was the use of controlled explosions as a power source. Since the only substance available to generate such a reaction was gunpowder, that became his default fuel, and cannons, some of which were huge and could propel a projectile weighing more than a quarter ton, provided the shape of the housing. And, since the objective was to generate energy and not to kill one&#x2019;s neighbor, the canister would need to be closed at both ends. Finally, for maximum efficiency, whatever was employed inside the canister to be driven by the explosion would need to conform to its shape, a tool we now call a piston.<br><br>Huygens built such a device in 1673, but he made an odd discovery. After ignition, rather than being driven outward by the force of the explosion, his primitive piston was drawn back. Oxygen had yet to be identified as an element, so Huygens was unaware that the explosion had burned off the gas, creating a partial vacuum and therefore an atmospheric imbalance that the piston was sucked in to equalize. Motors that ran on this principle would be known as &#x201c;atmospheric engines.&#x201d; Only later would experimenters discover that in order to fully harness the force of the explosion, it would be necessary to compress the fuel in the cylinder before ignition.<br><br>While Huygens had produced a theoretical prototype, his construction had obvious flaws, the most significant of which was that there was no means to keep the contraption running, since the cylinder had to be reloaded after each discharge. Gunpowder, a solid, was not at all suited to any device that was meant to run continuously. So primitive was Huygens&#x2019;s apparatus that no one thought to improve in-�cylinder explosive devices for almost two centuries. The encased piston, however, was almost immediately utilized to provide power generated from other sources. In 1690, Denis Papin, a French mathematician who had once been Huygens&#x2019;s assistant, created a partial vacuum in a cylinder by condensing steam, a spur that eventually inspired one of history&#x2019;s most significant technological advances.<br><br>As iron came increasingly to replace wood, the great engineering challenge of the period was the development of an effective means to pump water out of mines and thus allow miners to access ore much deeper underground. In 1712, the year Papin died, Thomas Newcomen, an English iron merchant and lay preacher, built on both Papin&#x2019;s work and the experiments of another Englishman, Thomas Savery, and fabricated the first practical steam engine. He placed a boiler beneath a cylinder, forcing steam into the chamber, and then used water from a tank above to cool the cylinder and condense the steam. The resulting partial vacuum allowed atmospheric pressure to draw the piston downward. A valve between the boiler and the cylinder would open to allow the steam to enter, and then close when the cylinder was full; another valve from the water tank would open when the cylinder was full, and then close after the piston had been sucked downward. A rocking beam&#x2014;�a sort of seesaw&#x2014;�attached at a pivot point above the cylinder and had a chain fastened on one side that ran a pump, which would suck water from a mine as the piston descended on the opposite side.<br><br>Newcomen&#x2019;s engine could run continuously and reliably and was thus a boon to mine owners. But it was also highly inefficient. The cylinder had to be hot when the steam entered, then cold to create the vacuum, then hot again to continue the cycle. Such rapid and extreme changes of temperature engendered substantial heat energy loss and also put a strain on the iron cylinder wall. For all its shortcomings, however, Newcomen&#x2019;s engine remained the state of the art for three-�quarters of a century, until James Watt developed a vastly improved design, one that has remained more or less unchanged ever since.<br><br>Watt&#x2019;s engine was direct drive, that is, the piston was driven by the steam entering the cylinder and not sucked into a partial vacuum, as with atmospheric engines. He avoided energy loss by allowing his cylinder to remain hot. Waste steam was driven into a separate vessel by the downstroke of the piston, where it was condensed and then returned to the water tank to begin the water-�steam-�water cycle once more. A far more sophisticated system of valves controlled the movement of water and steam among the various components. Watt&#x2019;s ingenuity did not end with the engine&#x2019;s internals; he perfected methods for converting the piston&#x2019;s reciprocal (up-�and-�down) motion to rotary motion using gears, and also a linkage system to gain power from piston strokes in both directions, not just one, as with the chain. <br><br>Watt&#x2019;s engine and transfer system were far more powerful and efficient than Newcomen&#x2019;s, using only half as much coal to produce twice the output. Since no ignition was necessary&#x2014;�steam was created externally in a boiler and then piped into the cylinder&#x2014;�steam engines avoided the problem that had doomed Huygens&#x2019;s explosive prototype. With the supply of the two fuels for steam engines, water and coal, essentially inexhaustible, there seemed little incentive to experiment with gunpowder or any other combustible alternative.<br><br>With his partner and fellow Lunar Society member Matthew Boulton, Watt marketed his device in 1776, thus beginning an industrial revolution on one side of the Atlantic at the dawn of a political revolution on the other. The steam engine was soon employed in virtually every commercial process that demanded a consistent and reliable power source. Perhaps no other mechanical device in history caused such a rapid and profound change in the human experience. In many ways, the modern urban industrialized world could be thought to have sprung from the mind of James Watt.<br><br>Although Watt&#x2019;s engine, like Newcomen&#x2019;s, had been designed for stationary use, it was inevitable that the notion of applying steam power to locomotion would soon follow. Within decades, both steam locomotives and steamships would transport millions of tons of goods and millions of travelers greater distances and in less time than had previously been thought possible.<br><br>Applying steam power to personalized conveyances was another obvious extension of the technology, but it would require any such device to be engineered a good deal smaller and substantially lighter than had by then been achieved. The first man to successfully build a steam-�powered carriage was a French engineer, Nicolas Cugnot, who in 1769, predating Watt, fashioned a heavy three-�wheeled cart with a large boiler hanging over the front, driving the single front wheel, leaving the entire platform free to haul munitions or artillery. Cugnot&#x2019;s cart was quite cleverly constructed, with two cylinders operating alternately, utilizing a ratchet that created rotary power and also allowed the vehicle to be driven in reverse. In a demonstration in Paris, Cugnot&#x2019;s fardier � vapeur ran for fifteen minutes and attained the heady speed of 2 miles per hour.<br><br>But in a subsequent demonstration, due to &#x201c;the violence of its motions,&#x201d; as Automobile magazine later described it, Cugnot&#x2019;s machine seemed to have literally &#x201c;broken down a brick wall which stood in its way.&#x201d; Soon afterward, his sponsor, French foreign minister �tienne-�Fran�ois Choiseul-�Ambroise, fell out of favor at court. With the coming of the revolution, Cugnot&#x2019;s invention was abandoned entirely. And so the first practical, mechanically driven conveyance ever to grace a public road was cast aside, never to be resurrected, not even when ex-�artilleryman Napol�on Bonaparte was hauling cannon across Europe.<br><br>In the first decades of the nineteenth century, a series of Englishmen, first Richard Trevithick and then Sir Goldsworthy Gurney, built steam carriages that carried passengers. Gurney&#x2019;s traveled the 9 miles between Gloucester and Cheltenham three times a day at 12 miles per hour. In 1831, Walter Hancock began a shuttle between London and Stratford in an omnibus that could carry fourteen passengers.<br><br>Revolutionary though this transport might have been, the British public did not clamor for steam conveyance. The boilers threw off copious amounts of smoke and soot, which was not endearing either to those who had paid premium prices to ride in the thing or to anyone passing nearby. In addition, the boilers often exploded, the crankshafts regularly broke, and the vehicles had a disquieting habit of colliding with pedestrians or livestock, or crashing at what was then considered high speed. It is not difficult, therefore, to see why most of the populace preferred to travel cheaply and reliably in a carriage pulled by the more familiar and always agreeable horse. So irritating were steam tractors that, in 1865, Parliament passed the Red Flag Act, limiting the top speed of steam vehicles to 4 miles per hour and requiring that a man waving a red flag, presumably on foot, precede any such conveyance on a public highway.<br><br>Although steam tractors&#x2014;�heavy, bulky, and slow-�moving&#x2014;�continued to find application, particularly as farm vehicles, little progress was made in advancing the basic technology. At the close of the eighteenth century, however, coal, which powered the steam engine, yielded a promising alternative fuel source. In 1796, William Murdoch, the same Boulton &amp; Watt engineer who had invented the planetary gear system to convert up-�and-�down motion to rotary power, lit his house with a new fuel, coal gas, a mixture of hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide obtained by heating coal in the absence of air. The resulting product could then combust if mixed with oxygen. Coal gas, foul-�smelling and sooty as it might have been&#x2014;�and explosive if not properly vented&#x2014;�quickly enjoyed widespread use to heat homes and businesses, and for street lighting. By the second half of the nineteenth century, most major cities in Europe and the United States had run gas lines, which were widely accessed by both municipal and commercial customers.<br><br>Of course, if coal gas could burn, it might also be used to drive a piston. It took sixty years, but in 1860, a Belgian, Jean Joseph �tienne Lenoir, adapted the Newcomen engine to coal gas and created a horizontal, double-�acting piston with a shaft attached to a flywheel. To ignite the gas-�air mixture, Lenoir employed a constantly burning flame outside the cylinder that was sucked inside by the vacuum created when the piston passed by. Lenoir&#x2019;s motor could run continuously and produce up to 20 horsepower.<br><br>Lenoir patented the design in 1861, and it was soon licensed by a number of French manufacturers. Between three hundred and four hundred were eventually sold for use in light industry. But practical application only emphasized the Lenoir&#x2019;s flaws. With ignition occurring before the piston reached the end of its stroke, the engine dissipated a good deal of the piston&#x2019;s potential power. Also, as an atmospheric apparatus with no compression of the fuel in the cylinder, it burned excessive amounts of both gas and the oil that is needed in any engine in which every other piston stroke transmits power. One hundred cubic feet of gas were required to produce a single horsepower. The Lenoir was thus suited only for smaller tasks, where the more complex, economically scaled steam engine was too costly. It would also work only as a stationary device, with gas piped from an outside source. When Lenoir mounted his motor on a three-�wheeled carriage-�like vehicle, its range was minuscule because the gas in the tank he carried was depleted within moments.<br><br>But once the technology had been introduced, major improvements were soon made. The same year Lenoir received his patents, two Germans, Nicolaus Otto and Eugen Langen, theorized that compressing the fuel would add power and efficiency, and that the mixture should be ignited as the piston became tightest against the top of the cylinder, when compression was greatest. In 1864, they founded the Deutz Company to conduct their research. There they would eventually employ two young engineers named Wilhelm Maybach and Gott�lieb Daimler.<br><br>But Otto did not succeed in building a working compression engine&#x2014;�the explosions in the cylinder were too powerful. Rather than continue to experiment with compression, he and Langen settled for building an improved atmospheric engine. They exhibited their design at the Paris World&#x2019;s Fair of 1867, the Exposition Universelle d&#x2019;Art et d&#x2019;Industrie, and orders came rolling in. Although the Otto, as it came to be called, was almost unbearably loud, described as &#x201c;clanging like a rapid-�fire pile driver,&#x201d; the market for stationary power plants that could be installed on the factory floor had grown exponentially; Otto and Langen would eventually sell about five thousand of these new machines, the world&#x2019;s first mass-�produced mechanical engine.<br><br>The motor utilized a single inverted piston and, like the Lenoir, could run continuously off a city gas line. But Otto&#x2019;s engine needed only 45 cubic feet of fuel to achieve 1 horsepower, a vast improvement. Otto was also the first to convert the up-�and-�down reciprocal stroke to rotary motion by using a rack-�and-�pinion arrangement&#x2014;�a linear gear meshing with a circular one&#x2014;�and a one-�way clutch, which disengaged the gears during the piston&#x2019;s return stroke.<br><br>Although the Otto was still technically an atmospheric two-�stroke engine, it exhibited some crude characteristics of the more modern compression engine that Otto had first sought to build. Revenues from its sales funded a return to the research that Otto was convinced would yield a greatly improved product.<br><br>In 1876, he built one: the first modern internal combustion engine. Both atmospheric power and the two-�stroke design were scrapped. Instead, he used four strokes to complete a full cycle. During the first stroke, downward, a mixture of gas and air was sucked into the cylinder; an upstroke, generated by the flywheel, compressed it; a flame was introduced into the cylinder to detonate the fuel, and a downstroke, the power stroke, occurred; the piston was then sent back upward, again by the spinning flywheel, which forced the burnt gases out an exhaust valve. This four-�stroke operation, fuel efficient with great endurance, has remained the state of the art ever since. And although Otto&#x2019;s invention utilized only one cylinder, it would not be long before fabricators built a multiple-�cylinder engine, with the timing of the power strokes offset, thereby providing a continuous flow of enormous power while eliminating reliance on the flywheel. As an additional selling point, although it was still sufficiently loud to make conversation difficult in its proximity, the new creation was such an improvement over its predecessor that it was dubbed, without irony, &#x201c;the silent Otto.&#x201d;</p><h2>Ready, Freddy! #6: Help!

He teaches in the University of Mississippi's MFA program.</p>This immensely accomplished novel by the author of the Edgar Award-winning short story collection Poachers is based on a real-life feud in the 1890s that pitted the underclass-poor, mostly white sharecroppers-of Clarke County, Ala., against the land-owning gentry who could and did control their fate. But that simple summary does not do justice to the complex and incredibly violent events that shook the community. The seeds of the violent uprising are planted when Macky Burke, a poor, white teenage orphan living with his grandmother, the widow Gates, accidentally shoots local merchant Arch Bedsole during a holdup. Arch's enraged cousin, Quincy "Tooch" Bedsole, a down-at-the-heels farmer, cultivates those seeds with a mixture of resentment, greed and a desire for vengeance. He forms the "Hell-at-the-Breech" gang, made up of criminals and struggling white tenant farmers who but for their guns are nearly as powerless as the former slaves they compete with for work. Hell-at-the-Breech terrorizes Clarke County, exacting frontier justice (and cash) from the exploitative landowners, driving black sharecroppers out of the county and menacing the white farmers who are too law-abiding to join their ranks. Fighting the outbreak of violence is Sheriff Billy Waite, an essentially good man trying to keep the peace and administer justice in a lawless world. Despite an unremitting catalogue of violence, this gory book is a pleasure to read for its clean, unexpected turns of phrase (in a cotton field, "each tuft [is] white as a senator's eyebrow"); the laconic humor of its characters ("Rumors fly out of Mitcham Beat like hair in a catfight"); and vibrant, complex characters who spring from the pages. Franklin may have used history as a starting point, but he imagines the events in human terms, creating a book that transmutes historical fact into something much more powerful, dramatic and compelling.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The French Dog</h2><p>Joining their owners at caf�s, in shops, and just about everywhere else, dogs have always had a special place in French life.

With the king's men-at-arms in pursuit he fled to the south coast and sailed to France. There he was joined by Isabella, the Queen of England, who threw herself into his arms. A year later, as lovers, they returned with an invading army: King Edward II's forces crumbled before them and Mortimer took power. He removed Edward II&nbsp;in the first deposition of a monarch in British history. Then the ex-king was apparently murdered, some said with a red-hot poker, in Berkeley Castle.&nbsp;Brutal, intelligent, passionate, profligate, imaginative, and violent, Sir Roger Mortimer was an extraordinary character. It is not surprising that the Queen lost her heart to him. Nor is it surprising that his contemporaries were terrified of him. But until now no one has appreciated the full evil genius of the man. This first biography reveals not only Mortimer's career as a feudal lord, a governor of Ireland, a rebel leader, and a dictator of England, but also the truth of what happened that night in Berkeley Castle.</p><p>Ian Mortimer was educated at Eastbourne College, the University of Exeter, and University College London. He gained his Ph.D. in history from the University of Exeter and has subsequently held research posts at that university as well as the University of Reading and the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts.

General readers will be interested in the work's compatibility with Queen Isabella (2005) by the highly popular Alison Weir. The consort of Edward II, French-born Isabella allied herself politically and romantically with Mortimer. Author Mortimer prods the misty medieval sources to draw out their relationship, building the human story around the known facts of Mortimer's life. A loyal liege who battled Scotland's Bruce clan in Ireland and at the Battle of Bannockburn (1314), Mortimer fell out with Edward II, escaped from the Tower and a death sentence, but exacted vengeance by overthrowing Edward in 1327, ruling briefly with Isabella. But Mortimer faced the gallows following the usurpers' fall in a palace coup.

Speakeasies, luxury cars, women&#39;s liberation, bathtub gin and a booming economy kept the country&#39;s mood on the up-and-up. Women sheared off their locks and taped their chests, donning flapper dresses and dancing the Charleston until their legs gave out. Gangsters flourished in big cities and gangster movies flourished in Hollywood. It was the roaring twenties in America: a singular time in history, a lull between two world wars and the last gas before the nation&#39;s descent into the Great Depression. Forging the way into the future like a modern streamliner in a sea of antiquity, advertising in the 20s sought to bring avant-garde into the mainstream -- which it did with great success.</p><p>Taschen's legendary decade-by-decade chronicle of American advertising hits a high point in the book on the 1920s. Its hundreds of coruscatingly colorful Jazz Age advertisements, superbly reproduced on practically bulletproof paper, add up to an irresistible question: why stay this side of paradise when the new consumer culture can send you to heaven right now? Just look up: apple-cheeked cherubs bear steaming flapjacks to a beaming sleeper; fluffy, angel-like Michelin tire men ply the skies; the Certainteed building-supplies giant (a sort of Australopithecus Jolly Green Giant) throws his head back against billowing cumulonimbus clouds. Cecil B. de Mille&#x2019;s poster for his 1933 tsunami-disaster film <i>The Deluge</i> can't match the grandiosity of some of these ads for the humblest household products.<p> </p><p> After a short but sweet introductory essay by New York Times designer Steven Heller, editor Jim Heimann organizes the ads by subject: consumer products, fashion and beauty, entertainment, travel, etc. It's gripping to watch sex and status try to outdo each other in selling 1920s cars: the snooty Pierce Arrow associates itself with wealthy Century Club types, while the Ford Fordor stresses the populist $660 price and the flapper struggling to keep the wind from whipping her perilously brief hem over her head. High art rears its lovely head in ads for the Marmon Big 8 racer, powered by a 125-horsepower engine and a lightninglike look derived from Futurist art. Most ads range in a safer esthetic region bounded by retro-Currier &amp; Ives, zesty art deco, and the funny papers. Fear is a great motivator: hunky Marvin loses the girls to halitosis; classy dames subtly judge each other on the quality of the ScotTissue in the bathroom: "Women sense it immediately!" The ads featuring black people fascinatingly demonstrate that even the era's most talented artists couldn't draw blacks because they literally could not see them when they looked at them. This book is a must for any serious student of pop culture&#x2014;or anybody out for a graphic good time. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>The author: <br>Steven Heller is the art director of The New York Times Book Review and co-chair of MFA Design at the School of Visual Arts.

The house has lately been the scene of notorious political scandal, but more crucially it is home to efforts to transform the very fabric of American democracy. And now, after laying bare its tenants' past in <i>The Family</i>, Sharlet reports from deep within fundamentalism in today's world, revealing that the previous efforts of religious fundamentalists in America pale in comparison with their long-term ambitions.<br><br>When Barack Obama entered the White House, headlines declared the age of culture wars over. In <i>C Street,</i> Sharlet shows why these conflicts endure and why they matter now - from the sensationalism of Washington sex scandals to fundamentalism's long shadow in Africa, where Ugandan culture warriors determined to eradicate homosexuality have set genocide on simmer. <br><br>We've reached a point where piety and corruption are not at odds but one and the same. Reporting with exclusive sources and explosive documents from C Street, the war on gays in Uganda, and the battle for the soul of America's armed forces - waged by a 15,000-strong movement of officers intent on "reclaiming territory for Christ in the military" - Sharlet reveals not the last gasp of old-time religion but the new front lines of fundamentalism.</p><p>Jeff Sharlet, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Family</i>, is a contributing editor for <em>Harper's </em>and <em>Rolling Stone</em>, the coauthor, with Peter Manseau, of <em>Killing the Buddha</em>, and the editor of TheRevealer.org.

He lives in New Hampshire."At once a gripping political thriller, a masterpiece of investigative journalism, and a timely call to arms, <i>C Street </i>reveals all that can be hidden within an innocuous Washington address. Jeff Sharlet delivers a warning that the blurring of the line between church and state is both an urgent local problem and a matter of global concern." (<b>Peter Manseau, author of <i>Rag and Bone: A Journey Among the World's Holy Dead</i> and <i>Songs for the Butcher's Daughter</i></b>)<br><br>"Jeff Sharlet has an incredibly rare double talent: the instincts of an investigative reporter coupled with the soul of a historian." (<b>Hanna Rosin, author of <i>God's Harvard: A Christian College on a Mission to Save America</i></b>)<br><br>"Jeff Sharlet is one of the very best writers covering the politics of religion." (<b>Ken Silverstein, author of <i>Turkmeniscam: How Washington Lobbyists Fought to Flack for a Stalinist Dictatorship </i></b>)<br><br>"Few writers can pull off investigative journalism, historical research, and elegant storytelling. Sharlet does all this with a story that a lot of people don't want to hear and others won't believe." (<b>Diane Winston, author of <i>Red-Hot and Righteous: The Urban Religion of The Salvation Army </i></b>)<br><br>"[Sharlet] writes with insight, verve, and, thankfully, none of the bogus punditry and bad sociology that often passes for informed discourse about the contemporary role of religion in public life. His refreshing narrative style is as engaging as his groundbreaking information." (<b>Frederick Clarkson, <em>The Public Eye</em></b>)<br><br>"Un-American theocrats can only fool patriotic American democrats when there aren't critics like Jeff Sharlet around-careful scholars and soulful writers who understand both the majesty of faith and the evil of its abuses."

One was a celebrity at twenty-three, the other virtually unknown until his dying days. One was right-wing and religious, the other a socialist and an atheist. Yet, as this ingenious and important new book reveals, at the heart of their lives and writing, Evelyn Waugh and George Orwell were essentially the same man. <br><br>Orwell is best known for <i>Animal Farm</i> and <i>1984</i>, Waugh for <i>Brideshead Revisited</i> and comic novels like <i>Scoop</i> and <i>Vile Bodies</i>. However different they may seem, these two towering figures of twentieth-century literature are linked for the first time in this engaging and unconventional biography, which goes beyond the story of their amazing lives to reach the core of their beliefs&#x2013;a shared vision that was startlingly prescient about our own troubled times.<br><br>Both Waugh and Orwell were born in 1903, into the same comfortable stratum of England&#x2019;s class-obsessed society. But at first glance they seem to have lived opposite lives. Waugh married into the high aristocracy, writing hilarious novels that captured the amoral time between the wars. He converted to Catholicism after his wife&#x2019;s infidelity and their divorce. Orwell married a moneyless student of Tolkien&#x2019;s who followed him to Barcelona, where he fought in the Spanish Civil War. She saved his life there&#x2013;twice&#x2013;but her own fate was tragic.<br><br>Waugh and Orwell would meet only once, as the latter lay dying of tuberculosis, yet as <i>The Same Man</i> brilliantly shows, in their life and work both writers rebelled against a modern world run by a privileged, sometimes brutal, few. Orwell and Waugh were almost alone among their peers in seeing what the future&#x2013;our time&#x2013;would bring, and they dedicated their lives to warning us against what was coming: a world of material wealth but few values, an existence without tradition or community or common purpose, where lives are measured in dollars, not sense. They explained why, despite prosperity, so many people feel that our society is headed in the wrong direction. David Lebedoff believes that we need both Orwell and Waugh now more than ever.<br><br>Unique in its insights and filled with vivid scenes of these two fascinating men and their tumultuous times, <i>The Same Man</i> is an amazing story and an original work of literary biography.</p><p>David Lebedoff is the award-winning author of five books, including <i>Cleaning Up</i>, about the Exxon Valdez case, and <i>The Uncivil War: How a New Elite Is Destroying Our Democracy</i>. Lebedoff is a graduate of the University of Minnesota and the Harvard Law School. He lives in Minneapolis with his wife and three children.<b>&#x201c;Nimble and provocative.&#x201d;</b>&#x2014;Michiko Kakutani,<i> New York Times</i><br><b>&#x201c;The peace that Orwell and Waugh found with each other suggests a common ground for liberals and conservatives of today.&#x201d;</b>&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><b>&#x201c;Lebedoff has pulled off a literary hat trick. It isn't possible to find two 20th-century literary peers who, at first glance, seem more different in ambition, temperament and subject matter than the authors of, respectively,<i> 1984</i> and<i> Brideshead Revisited</i> (both of which have been filmed twice, including a version of<i> Brideshead</i> currently in theaters). The connections, though, have been there all along, slipping past previous literary scholars who couldn't see beyond appearance.&#x201d;</b>&#x2014;<i>Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</i><br><b>&#x201c;<i>The Same Man</i> places the work of these two literary giants cheek by jowl. Comparisons are riveting, but the conclusion is dire. For as we read Orwell and Waugh's prophetic warnings we cannot help a shiver of recognition. We have created a world they would have abhorred.&#x201d;</b>&#x2014;<i> The Times</i> (London)<br><b>&#x201c;Just the kind of book that both Waugh and Orwell, full of passion and conviction themselves, might have enjoyed&#x2014;or enjoyed arguing with.&#x201d;</b>&#x2014;<i>Wall Street Journal</i><br><b>&#x201c;The two met only once, in late August of 1949. Waugh, who had written Orwell an admiring note, visited him as Orwell lay dying. It was an act of disinterested kindness on the part of a man known more for his rudeness than for his charity. No record remains of their conversation that day. But certainly, as Lebedoff shows, they were secret sharers, and they recognized it at the last. Seen through the honest window pane of good prose, their worlds were neither high nor low but one and the same. The deepest caves are linked by secret passageways to the peaks.&#x201d;</b>&#x2014;<i>New York Sun</i><br><b>&#x201c;A pithy, thoughtful study of two brilliant authors who, were they alive today, might very well have ended up supping together at a faded gentlemen's club lamenting the idiocies of the modern age and what Orwell aptly termed its "smelly little orthodoxies."</b>&#x2014;<i>Toronto Star</i><br><b>&#x201c;For those wearied by doorstop biographies, this lean and urbane dual portrait is a breath of fresh air. . . . Lebedoff nimbly compares and contrasts the lives and art of these literary titans.&#x201d;</b>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><b>&#x201c;This thrillingly written study of two of the 20th century&#x2019;s great social icons will impel readers to return to their timeless works.&#x201d;</b>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i><br><b>"Evelyn Waugh and George Orwell exemplified the brilliance of British writing in the 20th century, but we usually think of them as very different men.

Yet the mystery surrounding the death of his mother continues to plague his soul despite the moving efforts of his wife Bea and his faithful friend Fermn to save him.Just when Daniel believes he is close to solving this enigma, a conspiracy more sinister than he could have imagined spreads its tentacles from the hellish regime. That is when Alicia Gris appears, a soul born out of the nightmare of the war. She is the one who will lead Daniel to the edge of the abyss and reveal the secret history of his family, although at a terrifying price.The Labyrinth of the Spirits is an electrifying tale of passion, intrigue and adventure. Within its haunting pages Carlos Ruiz Zafn masterfully weaves together plots and subplots in an intricate and intensely imagined homage to books, the art of storytelling and that magical bridge between literature and our lives.'For the first time in 20 years or so as a book reviewer, I am tempted to dust off the old superlatives and event to employ some particularly vulgar clichs from the repertoire of publishers' blurbs. My colleagues may be shocked, but I don't care, I can't help myself, here goes. The Shadow of the Wind is a triumph of the storyteller's art. I couldn't put it down. Enchanting, hilarious and heartbreaking, this book will change your life.

Millionaire F. W. Woolworth built Winfield, the grandest of its manors in the 1910s. On a clear day, you can see the New York City skyline from its balustraded roof, yet for nearly a century few have been allowed to enter its gates. <br><br>In the 1960s Monica was living in one of the fabled mansions built by a Five-and-Dime heiress. While there, she began a career scouting locations for movie; she used many of the surrounding estates including Winfield. After a brief incarnation as a charm school, Winfield was closed and auctioned off. At the auction, Monica met a mysterious European businessman, who bought the house. After a whirlwind romance, they became engaged, and Monica moved in to Winfield, only to have her suspicions confirmed: Winfield is haunted. Amid magnificent gilded carvings and marble, a labyrinth of secret passageways, hidden chambers, and deserted tunnels help reveal the true nature of its eccentric builder. <br><br>Through exhaustive research and countless interviews, Monica gradually uncovered stories of the Woolworths&#x2019; sad past: the suicide of Edna Woolworth (Barbara Hutton&#x2019;s mother), Woolworth&#x2019;s obsession with Napoleon and the Egyptian occult, and the rumors surrounding the unsolved fire which burnt the first Winfield to the ground. This riveting memoir explores the culture and history of an era gone by, filled with enthralling stories of infamous scandals and breathtaking Gilded Age tales of New York society.

And he won. Quite as much as the Duke of Wellington it was the club-footed genius of French diplomacy who defeated the greatest conqueror since Julius Caesar. This is the story of Prince Talleyrand, who attracts as much scorn as Napoleon wins glory. To his critics the arch-aristocrat who delivered France and all Europe from the Emperor's follies is the prince of vice - turncoat, hypocrite, liar, plotter, God-baiter and womanizer, and, to make matters worse, highly successful at them all. <br><br>In this life of the master diplomat, David Lawday follows Talleyrand's remarkable career through the most turbulent age Europe has known and explores - for the first time - in intimate detail his extraordinarily perverse relationship with Napoleon. The richly flawed and abundantly gifted character laid bare by David Lawday is the man to whom diplomats continue to look today for the subtlest tricks of the negotiator's art. A good 150 years before a united Europe came into being, Talleyrand's actions laid the ground for it - as they have for a permanent peace now enduring for two centuries between France and her oldest enemy, Britain.</p><p>Napoleon&#39;s Master He took on Napoleon with a set of weapons that seemed unsuited to the task such as: flattery, courtesy and an alarmingly straight face.

Luckily they're not short on ingenuity and make a real deal. The simple, yet thoroughly satisfying, story is suitable for young toddlers through emerging readers. The crisp, rhyming sentences that tell the tale with economy and humor are enormously enhanced by Apple's wonderfully detailed colored pencil drawings. There's nothing sheepish about these lambs; they're energetic, expressive, and completely disarming. A rambunctious romp; let's hope there are more in store.<br><i>- Luann Toth, School Library Journal</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Folk Art Fusion: Americana: Learn to draw and paint charming American folk art with a colorful, modern twist</h2><p>Fans of Charles Wysocki, Mary Engelbreit, Grandma Moses, and folk art in general will fall in love with <i>Folk Art Fusion: Americana</i>.<br><br> Featuring projects that instruct artists of all skill levels how to draw and paint subjects that include quaint homes, pretty patterns, colorful gardens, picturesque farms, beautiful birds, and textured florals, this book features American-themed folk art infused with a modern twist.<br> &nbsp;<br> Beginning with an overview of what folk art is, followed by introductory topics like color, tools and materials, and drawing and painting techniques, <i>Folk Art Fusion: Americana</i> also includes 16 simple step-by-step projects done in approachable and&nbsp;popular mediums.

The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, the sequel to Davis&#39;s Pulitzer Prize-winning The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture and the second volume of a proposed trilogy, is a truly monumental work of historical scholarship that first appeared in 1975 to critical acclaim both academic and literary. This reprint of that important work includes a new preface by the author, in which he situates the book&#39;s argument within the historiographic debates of the last two decades.</p><p><br><strong>David Brion Davis</strong> is Sterling Professor of History at Yale University. A former President of the Organization of American Historians, he has won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, the Bancroft Prize, and the American Historical Association's Beveridge Award. His most recent book is <em>The</em> <em>Boisterous Sea of Liberty: A Documentary History of America from Discovery through the Civil War</em> (Oxford University Press, 1998, with Steven Mintz).<br><br>"<em>The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution</em> by David Brion Davis is a work of majestic scale, written with great skill. It explores the growing consciousness, during a half century of revolutionary change, of the oldest and most extreme form of human exploitation. Concentrating on the Anglo-American experience, the historian also pursues his theme wherever it leads in western culture. His book is a distinguished example of historical scholarship and art."--From the citation for the 1975 National Book Award<p></p><br>"In...<em>The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture</em>, David Brion Davis displayed his mastery not only of a vast source of material, but also of the highly complex, frequently contradictory factors that influenced opinion on slavery. He has now followed this up with a study of equal quality....No one has written a book about the abolition of slavery that carries the conviction of Professor Davis's book. And this rich and powerful book will, I am sure, stand the test of time--scholarly, brilliant in analysis, beautifully written."--J. H. Plumb, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"As Davis's work demonstrates, good intellectual history is absolutely essential for an adequate understanding of the past; its proper subject is the way flesh-and-blood human beings make sense out of their world and try to gain some kind of mastery over it....It is obvious that Davis's interpretation was not imposed on his sources but resulted from a struggle to give them whatever structure and coherence seemed most consistent with the data itself and with the best recent historical work in the field. Nor does he attempt to explain <em>all</em> responses to the problem of slavery as ideological....Indeed the greatest strength of the book arises from its ability to provide a convincing general interpretation while doing full justice to a variety of historical experiences and perspectives....It is hard to imagine anyone going over the same ground for a long time."--George M. Fredrickson, <em>The New York Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"A worthy successor to Davis's magnificent <em>The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture</em>. Together, these volumes represent the high point of scholarship in this field. They will undoubtedly remain at the center of discussion for many decades and perhaps beyond."--Edward Genovese<p></p><br>"One of the many remarkable things about this book is that it equals and even exceeds the level of scholarship and history established by the author's preceding volume."--C. Vann Woodward<p></p><br>"A superb continuation of Davis's work on the problem of slavery in western culture. It is a fascinating and profound study of the rise of the antislavery movement in England and America, as well as of the social, political, and economic milieu in which it operated."--Stanley L. Engerman<p></p><br>"A penetrating work of mature scholarship and extraordinary erudition....It deals with a historical problem of vast and enduring moral importance."--Michael Kammen<p></p><br>"One of the most stunning books I have ever read....What is overpowering is the magnitude of the questions Davis asks and the seriousness with which he probes their complexities."--Sanford Levinson<p></p><br></p><h2>Better Homes and Gardens Great Quiltmaking: All the Basics (Creative Quilting Collection)</h2><p>Covers equipment and supplies, preparing patterns and pieces, stitching, applique, finishing, documentation, and other aspects</p><p></p><h2>Saint (Paradise Series, Book 2) (The Books of History Chronicles)</h2><p><p>"We call you Saint."</p><p>The name ignited a light in Carl's mind.

He is known for stories that combine adrenaline-laced plots with incredible confrontations between good and evil. He lives in Texas with his wife and children. Twitter @TedDekker, facebook.com/#!/teddekker<p> I see darkness. I'm lying spread-eagle on my back, ankles and wrists tied tightly to the bedposts so that I can't pull them free. </p> <p> A woman is crying beside me. I've been kidnapped. </p> <p> My name is Carl. </p> <p> But there's more that I know about myself, fragments that don't quite make sense. Pieces of a puzzle forced into place. I know that I'm a quarter inch shy of six feet tall and that my physical conditioning has been stretched to its limits. I have a son whom I love more than my own life and a wife named . . . named Kelly, of course, Kelly. How could I hesitate on that one? I'm unconscious or asleep, yes, but how could I ever misplace my wife's name? </p> <p> I was born in New York and joined the army when I was eighteen. Special Forces at age twenty, now twenty-five. My father left home when I was eight, and I took care of three younger sisters--Eve, Ashley, Pearl--and my mother, Betty Strople, who was always proud of me for being such a strong boy. When I was fourteen, Brad Stenko slapped my mother. I hit him over the head with a two-by-four and called the police. I remember his name because his intent to marry my mother terrified me. I remember things like that. Events and facts cemented into place by pain. </p> <p> My wife's name is Kelly. See, I know that, I really do. And my son's name is Matthew. Matt. Matt and Kelly, right? </p> <p> I'm a prisoner. A woman is crying beside me. </p> <p><em> &nbsp;</em></p> <p><em> &nbsp;</em></p> <p> Carl snapped his eyes wide open, stared into the white light above him, and closed his eyes again. </p> <p> Opening his eyes had been a mistake that could have alerted anyone watching to his awakening. He scrambled for orientation. In that brief moment, eyes opened wide to the ceiling, his peripheral vision had seen the plain room. Smudged white walls. Natural light from a small window. A single fluorescent fixture above, a dirty mattress under him. </p> <p> And the crying woman, strapped down beside him. </p> <p> Otherwise the room appeared empty. If there was any immediate danger, he hadn't seen it. So it was safe to open his eyes. </p> <p> Carl did, quickly confirmed his estimation of the room, then glanced down at a thick red nylon cord bound around each ankle and tied to two metal bedposts. Beside him, the woman was strapped down in similar manner. </p> <p> His black dungarees had been shoved up to his knees. No shoes. The woman's left leg lay over his right and was strapped to the same post. Her legs had been cut and bruised, and the cord was tied tightly enough around her ankles to leave marks. She wore a pleated navy-blue skirt, torn at the hem, and a white blouse that looked as if it had been dragged through a field with her. </p> <p> This was Kelly. He knew that, and he knew that he cared for Kelly deeply, but he was suddenly unsure why. He blinked, searching his memory for details, but his memory remained fractured. Perhaps his captors had used drugs. </p> <p> The woman whose name was Kelly faced the ceiling, eyes closed. Her tears left streaks down dirty cheeks and into short blond hair. Small nose, high cheekbones, a bloody nose. Several scratches on her forehead. </p> <p><em> I'm strapped to a bed next to a woman named Kelly who's been brutalized. My name is Carl and I should feel panic, but I feel nothing</em> . </p> <p> The woman suddenly caught her breath, jerked her head to face him, and stared into his soul with wide blue eyes. </p> <p> In the space of one breath, Carl's world changed. Like a heat wave vented from a sauna, emotion swept over him. A terrible wave of empathy laced with a bitterness he couldn't understand. But he understood that he cared for the woman behind these blue eyes very much. </p> <p> And then, as quickly as the feeling had come, it fell away. </p> <p> "Carl . . ." Her face twisted with anguish. Fresh tears flooded her eyes and ran down her left cheek. </p> <p> "Kelly?" </p> <p> She began to speak in a frantic whisper. "We have to get out of here! They're going to kill us." Her eyes darted toward the door. "We have to do something before he comes back. He's going to kill . . ." Her voice choked on tears. </p> <p> Carl's mind refused to clear. He knew who she was, who he was, why he cared for her, but he couldn't readily access that knowledge. Worse, he didn't seem capable of emotion, not for more than a few seconds. </p> <p> "Who . . . who are you?" </p> <p> She blinked, as if she wasn't sure she'd heard him right. "What did they do to you?" </p> <p> He didn't know. They'd hurt him, he knew that. Who were they? Who was she? </p> <p> She spoke urgently through her tears. "I'm your wife! We were on vacation, at port in Istanbul when they took us. Three days ago. They . . . I think they took Matthew. Don't tell me you can't remember!" </p> <p> Details that he'd rehearsed in his mind before waking flooded him. He was with the army, Special Forces. His family had been taken by force from a market in Istanbul. Matthew was their son. Kelly was his wife. </p> <p> Panicked, Carl jerked hard against the restraints. He was rewarded with a squealing metal bed frame, no more. </p> <p> Another mistake. Whoever had the resources to kidnap them undoubtedly had the foresight to use the right restraints. He was reacting impulsively rather than with calculation. Carl closed his eyes and calmed himself. <em>Focus, you have to focus</em>. </p> <p> "They brought you in here unconscious half an hour ago and gave you a shot." Her words came out in a rush. "I think . . . I'm pretty sure they want you to kill someone." Her fingers touched the palm of his hand above their heads. Clasped his wrist. "I'm afraid, Carl. I'm so afraid." Crying again. </p> <p> "Please, Kelly. Slow down." </p> <p> "Slow down? I've been tied to this bed for three days! I thought you were dead! They took our son!" </p> <p> The room faded and then came back into focus. They stared at each other for a few silent seconds. There was something strange about her eyes. He was remembering scant details of their kidnapping, even fewer details of their life together, but her eyes were a window into a world that felt familiar and right. </p> <p> They had Matthew. Rage began to swell, but he cut it off and was surprised to feel it wane. His training was kicking in. He'd been trained not to let feelings cloud his judgment. So then his not feeling was a good thing. </p> <p> "I need you to tell me what you know." </p> <p> "I've told you. We were on a cruise--" </p> <p> "No, everything. Who we are, how we were taken. What's happened since we arrived. Everything." </p> <p> "What did they do to you?" </p> <p> "I'm okay. I just can't remember--" </p> <p> "You're bleeding." She stared at the base of his head. "Your hair . . ." </p> <p> He felt no pain, no wetness from blood. He lifted his head and twisted it for a look at the mattress under his hair. A fist-sized red blotch stained the cover. </p> <p> The pain came then, a deep, throbbing ache at the base of his skull. He laid his head back down and stared at the ceiling. With only a little effort he disconnected himself from the pain. </p> <p> "Tell me what you remember." </p> <p> She blinked, breathed deliberately, as if she might forget to if she didn't concentrate. "You had a month off from your post in Kuwait and we decided to take a cruise to celebrate our seventh anniversary. Matthew was buying some crystallized ginger when a man grabbed him and went into an alley between the tents. You went after him. I saw someone hit you from behind with a metal pipe. Then a rag with some kind of chemical was clamped over my face and I passed out. Today's the first time I've seen you." She closed her eyes. "They tortured me, Carl." </p> <p> Anger rose, but again he suppressed it. Not now. There would be time for anger later, if they survived. </p> <p> His head seemed to be clearing. More than likely they'd kept him drugged for days, and whatever they'd put into his system half an hour ago was waking him up. That would explain his temporary memory loss. </p> <p> "What nationality are they?" </p> <p> "Hungarian, I think. The one named Dale is a sickening . . ." She stopped, but the look of hatred in her eyes spoke plenty. </p> <p> Carl blocked scattered images of all the possible things Dale might have done to her. Again, that he was able to do this so easily surprised him. Was he so insensitive to his own wife? </p> <p> No, he was brutally efficient. For her sake he had to be. </p> <p> Their captors had left their mouths free--if he could find a way to reach their restraints . . . </p> <p> The door swung open. A man with short-cropped blond hair stepped into the room. Medium height. Knifelike nose and chin. Fiercely eager blue eyes. Khaki cotton pants, black shirt, hairy arms. Dale. </p> <p> Carl knew this man. </p> <p> This was Dale Crompton. This was a man who'd spent some time in the dark spaces of Carl's mind, securing Carl's hatred. Kelly had said Hungarian, but she must have meant someone else, because Dale was an Englishman. </p> <p> The man's right arm hung by his side, hand snugged around an Eastern Bloc Makarov 9mm pistol. The detail was brightly lit in Carl's mind while other details remained stubbornly shrouded by darkness. He knew his weapons. </p> <p> Without any warning or fanfare, Dale rounded the foot of the bed, pressed the barrel of the Makarov against Kelly's right thigh, and pulled the trigger. </p> <p> The gun bucked with a thunderclap. Kelly arched her back, screamed, and thrashed against her restraints, then dropped to the mattress in a faint. </p> <p> Carl's mind passed the threshold of whatever training he'd received. His mind demanded he feel nothing, lie uncaring in the face of brutal manipulation, but his body had already begun its defense of his wife. He snarled and bolted up, oblivious to the pain in his wrists and ankles. </p> <p> The movement proved useless. He might as well be a dog on a thick chain, jerked violently back at the end of a sprint for freedom. </p> <p> He collapsed back onto the bed and gathered himself. Kelly lay still. A single glance told him that the bullet had expended its energy without passing through her leg, which meant it had struck the femur, probably shattering it. </p> <p> "I hope I have your attention," Dale said. "Her leg will heal. A similar bullet to her head, on the other hand, will produce far more satisfying results. I'd love to kill her. And your son. What is his name? Matthew?" </p> <p> Carl just stared at him. <em>Focus. Believe. You must believe in your ability to save them. </em></p> <p> "Pity to destroy such a beautiful woman," Dale said, walking to the window. "Just so you know, I argued to tie your son next to you and keep Kelly for other uses, but Kalman overruled me. He says the boy will be useful if you fail us the first time." </p> <p> Englishman put the gun on the sill, unlatched the window, and pulled it up. Fresh breezes carried a lone bird's chirping into the room. <em>It's spring. I can smell fresh grass and spring flowers. I can smell fresh blood.</em></p> <p> Englishman faced him. "A simple and quite lethal device has been surgically implanted at the base of your hypothalamus gland. This explains the bleeding at the back of your head. Any attempt to remove this device will result in the release of chemicals that will destroy your brain within ten seconds. Your life is in our hands. Is this clear?" </p> <p> The revelation struck Carl as perfectly natural. Exactly what he would have expected, knowing what he did, whatever that was. </p> <p> "Yes." </p> <p> "Good. Your mission is to kill a man and his wife currently housed in a heavily guarded hotel at the edge of the town directly to our south, three miles away. Joseph and Mary Fabin will be in their room on the third floor. Number 312. No one else is to be killed. Only the targets. You have two cartridges in the gun, only two. No head shots. We need their faces for television. Do you understand?" </p> <p> A wave of dizziness swept through Carl. Aside from a slight tic in his right eye, he showed none of it. Beside him, Kelly moaned. How could he ignore his wife's suffering so easily? </p> <p> Carl eyed the pistol on the sill. "I understand." </p> <p> "We will watch you closely. If you make any contact with the authorities, your wife will die. If you step outside the mission parameters, she dies. If you haven't returned within sixty minutes, both she and your son will die. Do you understand?" </p> <p> Carl spoke quickly to cover any fear in his eyes. "The name of the hotel?" </p> <p> "The Andrassy," Dale said. He withdrew a knife from his waistband, walked over to Carl, and laid the sharp edge against the red nylon rope that tied Carl's right leg to the bed frame. </p> <p> "I'm sure you would like to kill me," Dale said. "This is impossible, of course. But if you try, you, your wife, and your son will be dead within the minute." </p> <p> "Who are the targets?" </p> <p> "They are the two people who can save your wife and son by dying within the hour." The man cut through the bonds around Carl's ankles, then casually went to work on the rope at his wrists. "You'll find some shoes and clean clothes outside the window." With a faint <em>pop,</em> the last tie yielded to Englishman's blade. </p> <p> Kelly whimpered, and Carl looked over to see that her eyes were open again. Face white, muted by horror and pain. </p> <p> For a long moment, lying there freed beside the woman he loved, Carl allowed a terrible fury to roll through his mind. Despite Dale's claim, Carl knew that he stood at least an even chance of killing their captor. </p> <p> He wanted to touch Kelly and to tell her that she would be okay. That he would save her and their son. He wanted to tear the heart out of the man who was now watching them with a dispassionate stare, like a robot assigned to a simple task. </p> <p> He wanted to scream. He wanted to cry. He wanted to kill himself. </p> <p> Instead, he lay still. </p> <p> Kelly closed her eyes and started to sob again. He wished she would stop. He wanted to shout at her and demand that she stop this awful display of fear. Didn't she know that fear was now their greatest enemy? </p> <p> "Fifty-eight minutes," Dale said. "It's quite a long run." </p> <p> Carl slid his legs off the bed, stood, and walked to the window, thinking that he was a monster for being so callous, never mind that it was for her sake that he steeled himself. </p> <p><em> I'm in a nightmare</em> . He reached for the gun. But the Makarov's cold steel handle felt nothing like a dream. It felt like salvation. </p> <p> "Carl?" </p> <p> Kelly's voice shattered his reprieve. Carl was sure that he would spin where he stood, shoot Dale through the forehead, and take his chances with the implant or whatever other means they had of killing him and his family. The only way he knew to deal with such a compelling urge was to shut down his emotions entirely. He clenched his jaw and shoved the gun into his waistband. </p> <p> "I love you, Carl." </p> <p> He looked at her without seeing her, swallowed his terror. "It'll be okay," he said. "I'll be back." </p> <p> He grabbed both sides of the window, thrust his head out to scan the grounds, withdrew, shoved his right leg through the opening, and rolled onto the grass outside. When he came to his feet, he was facing south. How did he know it was south? He just did. </p> <p> He would go south and he would kill. </p></p><h2>Electric Light: Poems</h2><p><br>A powerful new collection by the bestselling translator of <i>Beowulf</i>.<br><br><i>In the finland of perch, the fenland of alder, on air</i><br><br><i>That is water, on carpets of Bann stream, on hold</i><br><i>In the everything flows and steady go of the world.</i><br>--from "Perch"<br><br>Seamus Heaney's new collection travels widely in time and space, visiting the sites of the classical world and revisiting the poet's childhood: rural electrification and the light of ancient evenings are reconciled within the orbit of a single lifetime. This is a book about origins (not least, the origins of words) and oracles: the places where things start from, the ground of understanding -- whether in Arcadia or Anahorish, the sanctuary at Epidaurus or the Bann valley in County Derry.<br><br><i>Electric Light</i> ranges from short takes to conversation poems. The pre-Socratic wisdom that everything flows is held in tension with the elegizing of friends and fellow poets. These gifts of recollection renew the poet's calling to assign things their proper names; once again Heaney can be heard extending his word hoard and roll call in this, his eleventh collection.<br><br></p><p>Seamus Heaney's 11th collection of poems, <i>Electric Light</i>, continues his excavation of childhood, his vivifying love of nature, and his quest into the meaning of poetry itself in an utterly pleasurable and satisfying way. As the poet squares up to his own mortality, many of the poems are dedicated to the memory of lost friends and poets like Joseph Brodsky. Yet the urgency and optimism of new birth is a lively presence in the book too. "Bann Valley Eclogue," for example, prophesizes a time when "old markings / Will avail no more to keep east bank from west. / The valley will be washed like the new baby." And in "Out of the Bag," the child narrator believes that newborns emerge from the doctor's bag--or, in one hallucinatory moment, from the washbasin: "The baby bits all come together swimming / Into his soapy big hygienic hands." <p> Childhood is an unfading, unfailing element in Heaney's work, and is caught with a breathless vitality. "The Real Names" revisits the schoolboys who played Shakespeare: Owen Kelly as "Sperrins Caliban" with "turnip fists," and "Catatonic Bobby X" as Feste, "with his curled-in shoulders and cabbage-water eyes / speechlessly rocking." Here is the humor, exactness, scope, and tenderness of Heaney at his best. His language is as muscular and inventive as ever. Idiom meets innovation in compounds like <i>rut-shuddery</i> and <i>flood-slubs</i>--and <i>waver</i> is neatly subverted into a noun in "Perch." Throughout <i>Electric Light</i>, Heaney demonstrates exactly how poetry can capture the "flows and steady go of the world." <i>--Cherry Smyth</i></p><br>Seamus Heaney received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995. A resident of Dublin since 1976, he teaches regularly at Harvard University.

It was an article of faith that a saintly emperor, divinely appointed, had founded Constantinople and that the city was as holy as Rome or Jerusalem. The Byzantine emperors assiduously promoted the notion of a spiritual aura around the city. Thus, in 917, the emperor's regent wrote to the khan of the Bulgars warning him not to attack Constantinople. He did not threaten the khan with military force, but with the Virgin Mary who, as 'commander in chief of the city', would not take kindly to any assault. It was with legends and beliefs like this that the emperors bolstered their power and wealth, and the myth was central to the success of Constantinople and its empire for over a thousand years. <br><br>Although this is hardly the first history of Byzantium to be published, Jonathan Harris differentiates himself by offering keen insight into the spiritual and mythic dimensions of Constantinople, key elements of the city's history that have neglected until now. Constantinople: Capital of Byzantine is the first history of this great empire to properly examine the intriguing interaction between the spiritual and the political, the mythical and the actual. The result is an accessible and engaging account of a colorful and vital time in human history, and a long overdue look at an awe-inspiring city in its heyday.</p><p>Jonathan Harris taught English in Turkey before completing his doctorate in Byzantine History in 1993.

Deep down many of us believe that we are not good enough, and never will be good enough, to have a meaningful relationship with God.

As the weather wreaked havoc on land, the freezing Atlantic became a wind-whipped zone of peril. </p><p> </p><p> In the early hours of Monday, February 18, while the storm raged, two oil tankers, the <i>Pendleton</i> and the <i>Fort Mercer</i>, found themselves in the same horrifying predicament. Built with "dirty steel," and not prepared to withstand such ferocious seas, both tankers split in two, leaving the dozens of men on board utterly at the Atlantic's mercy. </p><p> </p><p> <i>The Finest Hours</i> is the gripping, true story of the valiant attempt to rescue the souls huddling inside the broken halves of the two ships. Coast Guard cutters raced to the aid of those on the <i>Fort Mercer</i>, and when it became apparent that the halves of the <i>Pendleton</i> were in danger of capsizing, the Guard sent out two thirty-six-foot lifeboats as well. These wooden boats, manned by only four seamen, were dwarfed by the enormous seventy-foot seas. As the tiny rescue vessels set out from the coast of Cape Cod, the men aboard were all fully aware that they were embarking on what could easily become a suicide mission. </p><p> </p><p> The spellbinding tale is overflowing with breathtaking scenes that sear themselves into the mind's eye, as boats capsize, bows and sterns crash into one another, and men hurl themselves into the raging sea in their terrifying battle for survival. </p><p> </p><p> Not all of the eighty-four men caught at sea in the midst of that brutal storm survived, but considering the odds, it's a miracle -- and a testament to their bravery -- that any came home to tell their tales at all. </p><p> </p><p> Michael J. Tougias and Casey Sherman have seamlessly woven together their extensive research and firsthand interviews to create an unforgettable tale of heroism, triumph, and tragedy, one that truly tells of the Coast Guard's finest hours. </p><p></p></p><p>Michael J.

G. Perry, 1898 </p></blockquote> <p> <b></b></p><b> Chatham, Massachusetts <p> February 18, 1952 </p></b> <p> Boatswain's Mate First Class Bernie Webber held a hot mug of coffee in his large hands as he stared out the foggy window of the mess hall. The cup of mud wasn't half bad. It came from a three-gallon pot and was brewed by mixing the coffee with a couple of eggshells to help the grounds settle at the bottom. The minister's son from Milton, Massachusetts, watched with growing curiosity and concern as the storm continued to strengthen outside. The midwinter nor'easter had stalled over New England for the last two days, and Webber wondered if the worst was yet to come. He watched as windswept snow danced over the shifting sands and large drifts piled up alongside the lighthouse tower in the front yard of the Chatham Lifeboat Station. At one time, two lighthouses had stood here; together they were known as the Twin Lights of Chatham. All that remained of the second lighthouse was an old foundation, and on this morning it was completely covered by snow. </p><p> Taking a sip of his coffee, Webber thought of his young wife, Miriam, home in bed with a bad case of the flu at their cottage on Sea View Street. What if there was an emergency? What if she needed help? Would the doctor be able to reach her in this kind of weather? These questions were fraying his nerves and Webber fought to put them out of his mind. Instead he tried to picture the local fishermen all huddled around the old woodstove at the Chatham Fish Pier. They would be calling for his help soon as their vessels bobbed up and down on the waves in Old Harbor, straining their lines. <i>If the storm is this bad now, what will it be like a few hours from now when it really gets going?</i> he thought. </p><p> Webber, however, wouldn't complain about the tough day he was facing. The boatswain's mate first class was only twenty-four years old, but he had been working at sea for nearly a decade, having first served with the U.S. Maritime Service during World War II. Webber's three older brothers had also served in the war. Paul, the eldest, had been with the Army's 26th Division in Germany. The so-called Yankee Division had fought in the Battle of the Bulge, joining General George S. Patton's Third Army in capturing the fortified city of Metz. Bob, his next brother, helped protect the homeland with the U.S. Coast Guard. The third, Bill, had helped build the Alaska Highway as a member of the Army Transportation Corps. </p><p> Bernie had followed his brother Bob into the Coast Guard, but it was not the kind of life his parents had planned for him. From early childhood, Webber's father, the associate pastor at the Tremont Temple Church in Boston, had steered him toward a life in the ministry. The church deacon even paid for Bernie to attend the Mount Hermon School for Boys, located 105 miles away in Gill, Massachusetts, a small town hugging the Connecticut River. Established in 1879, the school boasted prestigious alumni such as <i>Reader's Digest</i> founder DeWitt Wallace and James W. McLamore, who founded Burger King. Needless to say, Bernie was something of an economic outcast amongst the prep school crowd. He arrived at Mount Hermon carrying serious doubts and wearing his brother's hand-me-down clothes. He was not a strong student and he privately questioned why he was there. Webber knew in his heart that he did not want to follow in his father's footsteps. He was thinking about running away from school when fate intervened; a childhood friend who had crashed his father's car came looking for a place to hide out. Webber obliged his buddy's request, ensconcing him in one of the dorm rooms and swiping food from the school cafeteria for him to eat. The two were caught after just a few days but they didn't stick around long enough to face the consequences. Instead they fled to the hills and cornfields surrounding the school and eventually made it back to Milton. </p><p> The Reverend Bernard A. Webber struggled to understand the actions of his wayward son as young Bernie quit school and continued to drift. A year later, at the age of sixteen, Bernie got an idea that would change the course of his rudderless life. He heard that the U.S. Maritime Service was looking for young men like him for training in New York. If Bernie could complete the arduous training camp, he could then serve the war effort on a merchant ship. After his father reluctantly signed his enlistment papers, he quickly joined up and was schooled on the fundamentals of seamanship at the U.S. Maritime Service Training Station in Sheepshead Bay, New York, where he also received training from former world heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, then serving as a commander in the Coast Guard as well as the athletic instructor at the training station. When he was finished, Webber shipped out on the <i>SS Sinclair Rubiline</i>, a T2 oil tanker that ran gasoline from ports in Aruba and Curacao to American warships of the U.S. Third Fleet in the South Pacific. During this time, the young man realized that he would not spend his life in the ministry or any other job on dry land. Bernie Webber had been born to the sea. He enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard on February 26, 1946, and was sent to its training station at Curtis Bay, Maryland. In letters to recruits at the time, the commanding officer of the Coast Guard training station summed up the life and duty of a Coast Guardsman this way: </p><p> </p><blockquote> Hard jobs are routine in this service. In a way, the Coast Guard is always at war; in wartime, against armed enemies of the nation; and in peacetime, against all enemies of mankind at sea; Fire, Collision, Lawlessness, Gales, Ice, Derelicts, and many more. The Coast Guard, therefore, is no place for a quitter, or for a crybaby, or for a lying four-flusher, or anyone who cannot keep his eye on the ball. Your period of recruit training is a time of a test, hour by hour and day by day, to determine whether or not you are made of the right material. It is up to you, as an individual to prove your worth. </blockquote> <p> Webber was now on duty in Chatham, a tiny outpost at the elbow of Cape Cod. His worth and his mettle had already been tested many times in the unforgiving waters off the Cape. It was one of the busiest and most dangerous places for anyone who made their living on the sea. The director of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey made a point of this way back in 1869. "There is no other place in the world, perhaps," he wrote about the waters off Cape Cod, "where tides of such very small rise and fall are accompanied by such strong currents running far out to sea." In fact, seamen referred to the area as "the graveyard of the Atlantic," and for good reason. The sunken skeletons of more than three thousand shipwrecks were scattered across the ocean floor from Chatham to Provincetown. The first known wreck was the <i>Sparrowhawk</i>, which ran aground on December 17, 1626, in Orleans. The crew, along with colonists bound for Virginia, managed to get to shore safely, and the vessel was repaired. But before it could hoist its sails again, another devastating ocean storm came along and sunk the Sparrowhawk for good. The episode was detailed by Governor William Bradford in his diary of the Plymouth Colony. Two hundred years later, erosion brought the wreckage into view in a mud bank along the Orleans coastline. The famous HMS <i>Somerset</i> also met her fate in the treacherous waters off Cape Cod. The ship, immortalized in Longfellow's poem "The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere," was wrecked in the shoals off Truro during a violent gale on November 3, 1778. Twenty-one British officers and seamen drowned when their lifeboat overturned coming ashore. The ship's captain, George Ourry, surrendered to Truro selectman Isaiah Atkins on behalf of his 480-man crew. The survivors were taken as prisoners of war and were then marched to Boston, escorted by town militias along the way. (Paul Revere, who had once rowed stealthily past the Somerset to alert Lexington and Concord of the British invasion, was later given the ship's sixty-four guns to help fortify Castle Island in Boston Harbor.) As author Henry C. Kittredge observed in <i>Cape Cod: Its People &amp; Their History</i> (1930), "If all the wrecks which have been piled upon the back-side of Cape Cod were placed bow to stern, they would make a continuous wall from Chatham to Provincetown." </p><p> Bernie Webber's baptism under fire had come during an evening in 1949 when he responded to his first distress call at the Chatham Lifeboat Station. The Gleaves-class destroyer USS <i>Livermore</i> had run aground on Bearse's Shoal, off Monomoy Island. Luck had sailed with the <i>Livermore</i> up to that point. Her crew had managed to dodge Nazi U-boat wolfpacks while escorting convoys to Iceland bound for England in the months before the United States entered World War II. On November 9, 1942, the destroyer took part in the Allied invasion of North Africa, providing antisubmarine, antiaircraft, and fire support off Mehdia, French Morocco.

Perhaps the greatest warriors in history, the Samurai were a product of a social system totally geared to war. The Samurai became expert in fighting both on horseback and on the ground. Their way of life was dictated by the code of Bushido or &#39;way of the warrior&#39; and clad in their magnificent, multi-coloured armour they were perfectly suited to the violent clan and dynastic warfare that dominated medieval Japan as the most powerful families vied for supremacy. In this title Anthony J Bryant presents a fascinating overview of these truly �lite warriors.</p><p>An unrivalled illustrated reference source on fighting men and commanders, past and present. Each volume is packed with full colour artwork, making military history uniquely accessible to enthusiasts of all ages.Anthony Bryant is a historian specialising in medieval Japanese history. He graduated from Florida State University in 1983 with a degree in Japanese Area studies. He lived for some time in Tokyo and is a member of the Japan Armour and Weapons Research and Preservation Society. He has published numerous articles on the subject of Japanese arms and is the author of two books on the Samurai, in the Osprey Elite series.</p><h2>The Whole Story of Climate: What Science Reveals About the Nature of Endless Change</h2><p>In the publicity surrounding global warming, climate scientists are usually the experts consulted by the media. We rarely hear from geologists, who for almost two hundred years have been studying the history of Earth&#39;s dramatic and repeated climate revolutions, as revealed in the evidence of rocks and landscapes. This book, written by a geologist, describes the important contributions that geology has made to our understanding of climate change. What emerges is a much more complex and nuanced picture than is usually presented. While the average person often gets the impression that the Earth&#39;s climate would be essentially stable if it weren&#39;t for the deleterious effects of greenhouse gases, in fact the history of the earth over many millennia reveals a constantly changing climate. As the author explains, several long cold eras have been punctuated by shorter warm periods. The most recent of these warm spells, the one in which we are now living, started ten thousand years ago; based on previous patterns, we should be about due for the return of another frigid epoch. Some scientists even think that the warming of the planet caused by man-made greenhouse gasses tied to agriculture in the past few thousand years may have held off the next ice age. Though this may be possible, much remains uncertain.But what is clearly known is that major climate shifts can be appallingly rapid--occurring over as little as twenty or thirty years. One danger of dumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is that they may increase the chance that this &#34;climate switch&#34; will be thrown, with catastrophic effects on worldwide agriculture. Besides her discussion of climate, the author includes chapters on how early naturalists pieced together the complicated geological history of Earth, and she teaches the reader how to interpret the evidence of rock formations and landscape patterns all around us.Accessible and engagingly written, this book is essential reading for anyone looking to understand one of our most important contemporary debates.</p><p><b>E.

And that&#x2019;s not just a description of ancient history, when dinosaurs roamed the world. Instead, it&#x2019;s the clear record of climate change during recent times, when fully modern <i>Homo sapiens</i> left Africa, spread around the world, and ultimately founded our varied cultures and civilizations.&nbsp;<br><br>What&#x2019;s even more alarming than the recent dates and staggering scale of climate upheavals is how quickly they have swept over the Earth. Many of these have not been gradual events, unfolding over dozens of centuries or millennia. Indeed, as we now know, most major climate changes in geologically recent times have occurred in a mere twenty or thirty years. In other words, in the span of a single human lifetime, Earth&#x2019;s climate has crashed from warm times much like the present to Ice Age conditions &#x2014; or rocketed back again to warmth. In between these catastrophic changes there have been numerous smaller, but still substantial, climate shifts. Even these lesser events have been more than sufficient to quickly alter entire ecosystems, and most of them have been devastatingly fast.&nbsp;<br><br>The more scientists learn about the natural climate revolutions woven into the fabric of the planet, the greater our awe about how supremely fickle is climate on Earth. And climate upheavals have rearranged more than just entire temperature charts. Wind, precipitation, and other elements of weather have been as varied as temperature change. For example, what is now the driest part of the Sahara Desert was only four thousand years ago a lush and verdant landscape with lakes, fish, crocodiles, turtles, and people. But when climate turned yet another corner in Earth&#x2019;s long history, the rains shifted far to the south and the green splendor vanished, along with the people. Today, in the same spot, there is nothing but sand.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>No full climate crash has occurred in the span of written history. That may be chance, or it may be that if there had been a fully global and rapid climate revolution, early civilizations would not have survived, so we would not be here. But, in any event, the simple fact that we don&#x2019;t have <i>written records</i> of natural and extreme global climate revolutions accounts for a large measure of the ignorance of even the educated public about the behavior of climate on Earth. But geologists can read the <i>physical record</i> of the enormous changes that swept over the globe before civilization was established and our written history commenced. The signs are plain once you learn to see them: Earth&#x2019;s global climate reverses, staggers, and stumbles, again and again, sometimes with changes that occur within the span of a single human life. What&#x2019;s worse, the Earth looks like she may be overdue for another, fully natural, climate revolution, as well as for more moderate and ongoing climate shifts.&nbsp;<br><br>The public has heard a great deal in recent years from the ranks of climate science, a discipline that&#x2019;s partially distinct from geology. There&#x2019;s much to be valued in the complex computer models that climate scientists use. But climate science is quite a recent branch of research, and climate scientists are not the only ones with professional opinions about the Earth. For almost two hundred years geologists have studied the basic evidence of how climate has changed on our planet. We don&#x2019;t generally traffic in computer models so much as direct physical evidence left in the muck and rocks of our planet. From those kinds of grubby facts, which this book will explain at a level any interested citizen can follow, we know a great deal about how climate has actually changed. As geologists, we also have evidence from many millennia and even millions of years under our belts, from periods of complete cycles of bitter cold to balmy warmth and back again to deep-freeze conditions.&nbsp;<br><br>Regardless of American energy policies and our greenhouse gas emissions, changes in climate &#x2014; including both massive and moderate upheavals in temperature and precipitation &#x2014; are going to be a part of Earth&#x2019;s future, just as they have been the bedrock of the past. That&#x2019;s why the public and American policymakers need to understand what geologists know of past climate changes. Failing to discuss the evidence of both massive and moderate natural climate change is like speeding downhill on a bicycle at fifty miles per hour while wearing a blindfold. We can, if we wish, spend the next minute tightening the strap on our helmet. But ripping off the blindfold seems a wiser first step toward giving us a chance of survival. And the only way to start to see around us clearly is to look at the record of what climate has done in Earth&#x2019;s past. Some of the facts we can draw out from the Earth&#x2019;s records are encouraging, while many are quite challenging. But it&#x2019;s surely better to be informed about how climate on Earth behaves than to willfully wear a blindfold at this critical crossroads of our history.<br><br>Please understand, geologists are not Luddites who say we should have no concern about our production of greenhouse gases, nor do we argue that what you&#x2019;ve heard in the popular press about global warming is hogwash. But some of us believe you&#x2019;ve been told only one isolated part of a much longer and richer climate story. To understand what might come next for climate &#x2014; no matter our carbon policies or lack thereof &#x2014; you need to understand what geologists know about Earth&#x2019;s past climates.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s a simple analogy: if you were facing a crippling medical condition, you might be well advised to seek the opinion of differently trained medical professionals &#x2014; perhaps surgeons, internists, and pharmacists. In the same way, you are well advised to listen to what geologists &#x2014; as well as climate and environmental scientists &#x2014; have to say about Earth&#x2019;s recent temperature and precipitation changes. The framework of geological knowledge is different than that of many climate and environmental scientists, and the advice we offer may differ from that of our colleagues in these younger disciplines. It&#x2019;s not that any one group has a monopoly on everything that&#x2019;s valuable, any more than cardiologists are always right and internists are always useless. Rather, before you make decisions about a route to follow, it&#x2019;s to your advantage to be informed about the lay of the land around you.&nbsp;<br><br>At the end of the day, many geologists feel strongly that the best guide we have to the future is the evidence of the past. The Earth&#x2019;s past is the part of the picture that&#x2019;s most clear, providing the data that are least in dispute. The past is also the realm in which geologists excel; it&#x2019;s the part of the puzzle to which we&#x2019;ve been devoted for many generations.&nbsp;<br><br>As it happens, many geologic principles can be quickly learned by amateurs. In just a few pages, this book will show you how geologists can literally see Earth&#x2019;s recent climates when we look out the window. You, too, can master this skill set, and you&#x2019;ll be able to understand the basic outline of climate, as Nature herself can show it to you around your house or during your summer vacation in the Rockies, New England, or around the Great Lakes. And I&#x2019;ll teach you what you need to know not through a list of facts, but by explaining the <i>story</i> of how geologists learned the basic principles that guide our science. In other words, this isn&#x2019;t a textbook, but a narrative, the story of what real-life geologists &#x2014; complete with human limitations and foibles &#x2014; learned as they examined the parts of the natural world influenced by climate change. It&#x2019;s an interesting detective story in its own right, but it will also give you the basic tools to see the climate evidence that, indeed, lies all around you.&nbsp;<br><br>Here&#x2019;s a warning: you may have to unlearn a couple of things you think you know. For example, many educated Americans live with the assumption that Earth&#x2019;s climate is quite static under natural conditions. The weather of our childhood, after all, felt like it was right and proper, the way the Earth was meant to be &#x2014; and remain. But thinking of climate as a constant is grossly misguided. The weather of our childhood, in fact, was different from the weather endured by the passengers on the <i>Mayflower</i> and also different from that in which Viking raiders harassed the people of Europe a thousand years ago. The weather we knew when we were children &#x2014; perfect and proper though it seemed &#x2014; was but a single snapshot of the ceaseless and unfolding process of ongoing climate change.&nbsp;<br><br>The notion that climate should remain the same over time is at the core of much of the recent discussion in the public square. Change &#x2014; including fully natural climate revolutions and more frequent and moderate climate shifts &#x2014; is understandably frightening. We naturally shy away from it. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s actually comforting to believe the message of extreme environmentalists in recent years. Their argument is that we humans are in the process of destroying the world as we know it through our production of greenhouse gases, that we are the sole cause of current climate change. From that premise it follows that if we slash emissions of carbon dioxide greatly enough, climate will stop changing. That&#x2019;s actually <i>reassuring</i> compared to the view offered to us by the Earth herself. The fact is, if human beings had remained hunter-gatherers throughout our entire history, never producing a single molecule of greenhouse gases through agriculture or industry, climate today would still be changing. It would be lurching toward higher temperatures, crashing toward vastly colder temperatures, or at least swinging toward something different from what has been. That&#x2019;s just the nature of Earth&#x2019;s climate. It&#x2019;s not to our liking, and it&#x2019;s not to say we should do nothing about curtailing greenhouse gas emissions, but surely we must look the basic facts of natural change in the face if we are to have useful policy debates in the public square.&nbsp;<br><br>Fortunately, most Americans have another and more useful childhood touchstone for memories when it comes to climate. Many of us recall the gist of books about the Ice Age that we read in grade-school libraries. Those books were decorated with images of saber-toothed tigers, giant ground sloths, and wooly mammoths. Behind a mammoth or two, in the distance, there was likely to be a sketch of a great glacier, perhaps with fissures lacing its edges. The world, it was clear in the books, had once been quite different, in terms of both climate and species.&nbsp;<br><br>Although such library treasures gave us some significant information about climate, it&#x2019;s also true that there&#x2019;s much more that&#x2019;s now known to science than the mere outline of the deep freeze you saw in grade school. In the past twenty years, scientists have found a richly detailed record of climate change in materials as humble as lakebed mud in North America and as pristine as glacial ice in Greenland and Antarctica. That physical record has shown us that major climate crashes are interspersed with the history of milder fluctuations. But &#x201c;milder&#x201d; is a comment based on the Earth&#x2019;s standards, not ours, because even milder changes have led to famines.&nbsp;<br><br>Here&#x2019;s just one example: a dose of natural climate change once hit the mightiest empire of the Bronze Age, the Egyptian kingdom of the River Nile and its broad delta. Some 4,300 years ago (2300 BCE), Egyptian civilization was flourishing, built on agriculture enriched by organized irrigation, rather than just the scratch-in-the-dirt approach to farming. Egypt&#x2019;s agriculture had led to population growth, big cities with educated elites, and well-trained and equipped armies. But, quite out of the blue, natural climate change hit the Egyptian empire, and it hit hard.&nbsp;<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t that temperatures changed much in North Africa but that precipitation patterns were altered. We have basic written accounts of this &#x201c;small&#x201d; change in climate &#x2014; small by the Earth&#x2019;s standards. As one written account makes plain, the famine and cultural collapse triggered by this relatively mild climate shift was so great that wealthy families in Egypt ate their own children. Thus, rapid climate change quickly brought the superpower of the day to the point that parents resorted to cannibalism &#x2014; just so the adults could survive a few more weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>While Egyptians were eating their offspring, climate change was affecting other parts of the Earth, too. In general, the higher latitudes of the planet are likely to experience more temperature changes during dynamic times. It is possible that global temperature changes &#x2014; and their related precipitation changes in Egypt &#x2014; were one part of what reshaped ecosystems in and around the arctic of that day. It was around that same point that the last, isolated bands of woolly mammoths disappeared from Wrangel Island, off the Siberian coast. The mammoths, that great symbol of the Ice Age in your childhood, had clung on for several thousand years after the enormous climate upheaval that occurred ten thousand years ago, but they didn&#x2019;t make it through the blip that hit them in the Bronze Age.&nbsp;<br><br>For animals and for people, Earth&#x2019;s climate is an adversary the like of which many policymakers and environmentalists have not yet dreamed. Natural climate change is the elephant in the room within our public discussion of climate. In our rush to start thinking about limiting our production of greenhouse gases &#x2014; a goal we will surely undertake to some degree &#x2014; we&#x2019;ve unfortunately left behind the reality of the history of Earth&#x2019;s climate. Natural climate change is fearsome to contemplate, to be sure. But the time has come to acknowledge the geologic elephant that&#x2019;s standing so near us. While we cannot tame or control the beast, we owe it to ourselves to recognize the facts of what Earth&#x2019;s climate is like. Planning for and adapting to climate change is as worthy a goal as limiting greenhouse gases, once we acknowledge how frequent and profound natural climate change is. No matter our political commitments, we can all surely come to better policy judgments about energy and climate by acknowledging the facts regarding how climate behaves. Doing so would certainly be better than prolonging our collective denial of what we are up against.</p><h2>Fairy &amp; Folk Tales of Ireland</h2><p>One of th eIReland&#39;s greatest writers, the Noble Prize winner, W.B.

In Gene Moore&#x2019;s case, that someone was the Brooklyn Dodgers.<br><br>Gene Moore was a farm boy living with his family in Sesser, Illinois, a town so small even map makers ignored it. As a teenager, when he wasn&#x2019;t in school or helping his Pop on the farm, slopping the hogs and doing other chores with his older brother Ward and five sisters, Gene was playing baseball with the guys on the town team. Some were twice his age. The older fellows didn&#x2019;t mind having the Moore kid on their team because he could hit the ball farther than anyone else, he was the best catcher anyone had ever seen, he could throw men out from his knees, and not a ball ever got past him. Gene was 15 years old. <br><br>Word quickly spread across the United States about the country boy who could hit the ball a country mile. The Dodgers wanted to take a look at this farm kid, barely old enough to shave and still awaiting his first kiss, but brash enough to call the pitches from behind the plate and motion to the infielders and outfielders as to how they should position themselves for certain hitters.<br><br>Headed for baseball stardom with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Gene&#x2019;s destiny was interrupted by Pearl Harbor. After playing ball for the Navy in the Azores and North Africa, Gene and his team were sent to the States for a special&#x2014;and top secret&#x2014;mission: guarding German sailors captured from U-505. Unable to field a team, Gene convinced his commander to allow him to teach the enemy how to play baseball while he and his teammates waited for the war to end so they could be called up into the Major Leagues.

Moore is known worldwide as an inspirational and motivational speaker of choice, successful entrepreneur, accomplished musician, and award-winning and critically acclaimed author.<i>Starred Review.</i> In 1940, at just 15 years old, small-town baseball star Gene Moore was signed to the Brooklyn Dodgers, who saw in him the potential to become one of the great catchers of all time. Before that could happen, though, WWII intervened. Gene's story, a surprising paean to the power and humanity of a game, is told here by his son, a first-time author who exhibits the confidence and pacing of a pro. His gripping material certainly helps: after several years overseas in the Navy's touring baseball team, Gene was brought back to Louisiana and assigned to guard secret German POWs, whose U-boat was captured just days before the storming of Normandy. There, Gene teaches his German captives how to play baseball, with a number of unintended and life-altering consequences. When Gene's finally able to return home to Sesser, Ill., he's "on crutches, depressed and embarrassed," holing up in the local bar and prompting one bartender to lament, "he's become one of us, when we were hoping he would make us like him." Gene's journey from promise to despair and back again, set against a long war and an even longer post-war recovery, retains every bit of its vitality and relevance, a 20th-century epic that demonstrates how, sometimes, letting go of a dream is the only way to discover one's great fortune.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His first book, Better Than Normal, was a New York Times bestseller.<p></p><p></p><p>FOREWORD</p><p>The time to view Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder through a new lens is long overdue. Dr. Dale Archer&#x2019;s <i>The ADHD Advantage</i> redefines all but the most severe cases of ADHD as expectable difference, not medical diagnosis. Hopefully, his work will help reverse the dangerous global trend that seeks to medicalize individual variability and medicate it into oblivion. Dale&#x2019;s view is quite different. Rather than suppressing ADHD symptoms, he finds the adaptive strengths in them that can be leveraged with awareness and the right set of tools. Pills are not always the answer.</p><p>As chair of the task force that produced the fourth edition of the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</i>, I have been alarmed by the tripling of ADHD rates in just twenty years. It&#x2019;s not that our kids are getting sicker. Human nature is remarkably constant. Some of the increase may be due to better recognition of real cases, but the evidence is overwhelming that we are in the midst of a fad largely engineered by drug companies&#x2019; misleading marketing to doctors, stressed parents and overworked teachers, as well as a quick-fix mentality and insurance demands that a diagnosis be made immediately on a first visit.</p><p>We are turning our kids into pill poppers. ADHD is now diagnosed in 11 percent of all children ages four through seventeen and is medicated in 6 percent. It is estimated that 15 percent of all children will get the diagnosis before they reach voting age. And the percentages get really crazy for teenage boys&#x2014;20 percent are diagnosed and 10 percent are medicated. Remarkably, a child&#x2019;s date of birth is the best predictor of whether he gets the label. The youngest kid in the class is almost twice as likely as the oldest to be diagnosed with ADHD. Misplaced diagnostic exuberance has turned age-appropriate immaturity into a psychiatric disease&#x2014;and treats it with a pill, rather than just letting the kid grow up.</p><p>The rates of ADHD jumped because of three events during the late 1990s. First, new and very expensive ADHD drugs came on the market. This provided the means and motive for aggressive marketing. Twenty years ago, sales of ADHD drugs in the United States totaled a modest $40 million; now they have soared to an obscene $9 billion. Most of this money would be better spent to improve schools by reducing class size and adding gym periods so that fidgety kids could blow off steam.</p><p>Second, drug companies were allowed for the first time to engage in direct-to-consumer advertising. Ads peddling the ADHD illness to sell the profitable pill soon dominated TV, the Internet and print media. The misleading message was that ADHD is common, underdiagnosed, the cause of all school and behavioral problems, the result of a chemical imbalance and easily treatable with a pill. The marketing was mostly aimed at primary care doctors, who now prescribe the bulk of psychiatric medicines. They usually write quick and unnecessary prescriptions after a very brief visit, being forced into a premature diagnosis in order to get paid. Kids are hard to diagnose and change a lot from visit to visit without intervention&#x2014;especially since they are often first seen on their worst day. Medication should be a last resort used only for the clearest, most impairing, most pervasive and most persistent disorders. Instead, the medicines are often passed out like candy.</p><p>Third, the first report from a multicenter study suggested that medication was superior to psychotherapy in treating ADHD. Subsequent follow-up studies failed to support the long-term effectiveness of medication, but these did not receive very much attention.</p><p>It is easy to overdiagnose and overtreat ADHD. It is defined by nonspecific symptoms and behaviors that are widely distributed in the general population: poor concentration, distractibility, impulsivity and hyperactivity. At the poles, the diagnosis is easily made. At one pole, the kid who presents with classic early-onset, severe ADHD is unmistakable. At the other are the kids who clearly do not have ADHD. But in between (at an arbitrary, flexible, fuzzy and heavily populated boundary), it is tough to distinguish clinical ADHD from normal kids who are no more than frisky and difficult to manage. Dale&#x2019;s ADHD continuum describes this in detail&#x2014;a new way of looking at symptoms that no longer warrants the immediate reflex of a prescription.</p><p>Overdiagnosis and loose prescription habits have fostered a thriving secondary market for pills originally intended for ADHD but instead illegally diverted for recreational use and/or performance enhancement. Remarkably, one-third of college students now use stimulants, as do one in ten high school students. Stimulant overdoses have quadrupled in recent years. And more than 10,000 two- and three-year-olds are already on stimulants. Things have gotten so out of hand that two federal agencies are now tussling over control of stimulant distribution: the Drug Enforcement Agency has clamped down on the production of stimulants, causing the Federal Drug Administration to express concern that not enough pills are available for legitimate use.</p><p>What started as a childhood epidemic is now also spreading rapidly to adults. ADHD promises to become a very popular diagnosis in this new market because virtually everyone would like to concentrate better and be less distractible. And the differential diagnosis in adults is particularly difficult because nonspecific ADHD-like symptoms accompany virtually every one of the psychiatric disorders. Far too often, ADHD is becoming a common add-on diagnosis&#x2014;especially used by clinicians prone to prescribing polypharmacy drug cocktails. Adult ADHD should be diagnosed only when symptoms are clear-cut, definitely impairing and had their onset in early childhood. There is no such thing as late-onset ADHD.</p><p>So, how can we sort things out? How can we succeed in reducing the overdiagnosis of ADHD without risking underrecognition and undertreatment? This book is a good place to start by recognizing that the ADHD has inherent strengths that, until now, have rarely been discussed. Dale has identified and explored several key advantages, including resilience, an ability to be calm in a crisis, a propensity for multitasking and a penchant for nonlinear thinking. He discusses new research and gives dozens of real-life examples of how these strengths play out in the day-to-day lives of people who have attained a level of personal and professional success in multiple fields, whether they are CEOs, teachers, truck drivers or small-town doctors. In addition, he highlights two fields in which those with ADHD appear to excel: athletics and entrepreneurship.</p><p>His takeaway is that by trying to suppress and medicate ADHD out of existence, we risk suppressing the gifts that are part of the package. Dale offers an array of useful and insightful alternatives for leveraging these strengths without the aid of a pill. Overmedicating, he argues, could dim the light that could be the next great business leader, explorer or innovator.</p><p>Parents are the first line of protection against the glut of medicating. Increasing physical activity can help fidgety kids. Enroll them in a team sport, swimming, yoga, martial arts, dance or tumbling&#x2014;anything to let the kid blow off steam and acquire discipline. This book lays out a host of pragmatic options for both children and adults to improve education, career and relationships. Not every difference is a sign of dysfunction. Kids differ in the pace of their development. Immaturity is not a disease. Medications can be helpful, sometimes essential, for clear-cut and severe cases when all else has failed, but only as a last resort, not as a careless panacea.</p><p>We don&#x2019;t help our kids by giving them an inaccurate ADHD diagnosis and prescribing unnecessary medication. We help our kids by loving them, accepting them and helping them to find and use their strengths.</p><p>&#x2014;Allen Frances, MD</p><p>Chair of the <i>DSM-IV</i> Task Force</p><p>Author of <i>Saving Normal</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>AUTHOR&#x2019;S NOTE</p><p>To respect the privacy of a few individuals mentioned in this book, names and identifying details have been changed. First and last names are used for those who were willing to be fully identified.</p><p></p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>What do David Neeleman, founder of JetBlue; John Chambers, CEO of Cisco; and business mogul Sir Richard Branson have in common? They, along with the singer Pink, Ty Pennington, Adam Levine and countless other high-profile achievers have publicly embraced their diagnosis of ADHD, and for good reason. For many, this trait is a blessing, not a curse.</p><p>It&#x2019;s time to dispel the widespread misperception that this is only an affliction in need of a fix. Even its name&#x2014;Attention Deficit Disorder or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder&#x2014;features a double whammy of negative connotations from those two <i>D</i>-words, implying that someone who possesses its typical characteristics is both broken and deficient. But this loaded term is a complete misnomer, because ADHD is not a minus. Leveraged and understood, it can be a huge plus! Just consider what David Neeleman has to say about the most overly diagnosed and medicated condition in mental health:</p><p>If someone told me you could be normal or you could continue to have your ADD, I would take ADD.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can distill complicated facts and come up with simple solutions. I can look out on an industry with all kinds of problems and say, &#x201c;How can I do this better?&#x201d;</p><p>He goes on to state that if there was a pill he could take to make it go away, he&#x2019;d refuse to take it, and he&#x2019;s absolutely right. Far from being a group of symptoms that need to be medicated and managed, the most common features are, in fact, strengths that some of the world&#x2019;s most accomplished people have leveraged to attain new heights in their chosen fields.</p><p>Those with ADHD are life&#x2019;s entrepreneurs, CEOs, leaders, explorers, champion athletes and out-of-the-box thinkers, with extraordinary abilities to work under pressure, rebound from crises, multitask and conceive of ideas outside the restrictions of linear thinking. While people with ADHD can have trouble focusing on any one task, if something piques their interest they can become hyperfocused, able to carry an idea or task through to new heights of achievement. They are also an overwhelmingly positive bunch, possessing an innate resilience, high energy and a sense of humor that allows them to get past the many challenges of day-to-day living, and to keep on trying.</p><p>Look closely at many of the world&#x2019;s most cutting-edge CEOs, those who have created new products, transformed their industry landscapes and founded their own businesses from scratch, and chances are you&#x2019;ll find they possess a greater or lesser degree of the ADHD trait. These are the people who push the boundaries of what&#x2019;s possible and refuse to accept the restrictions of the status quo, and that is a good thing.</p><p>Simply put, ADHD can be best understood as a brain with a very low boredom threshold. (Yes, this is greatly simplified; I wish it were so easy.) People who have it chafe against the mundane and routine, and yet they excel in chaotic situations. Centuries ago, they would have been the restless ones in the village during times of plenty. But when famine or catastrophe struck, they were the fearless leaders who found new lands or new ways of surviving. A research study found high populations of those with the genetic background for ADHD in far-flung places like Siberia, Tierra del Fuego and Australia, prompting scientists to refer to the dopamine transporter gene associated with ADHD as the &#x201c;explorer gene,&#x201d; something we&#x2019;ll be <i>exploring</i> in more detail in Chapter Four.</p><p>Now, I can&#x2019;t say for certain that this set of genes led the dawn of civilization, but there is no question they gave our adaptable and risk-taking ADHD forebears an evolutionary advantage. This genetic trait still exists in our species for a reason. Impulsivity, for example, which gets a bad rap today, could mean the difference between life and death in times of grave danger, when there is no time to waste analyzing a decision. Think about it. Our ADHD forebears were the prehistoric survivors who could calmly make a split-second decision to jump off a cliff to save themselves from a charging saber-toothed tiger. Jumping off a cliff may look crazy. But in fact, this impulsive act, or what some might call a gut instinct, is a split-second calculation based on the odds of survival. After all, a possible broken limb is better than being mauled to death. That quick reaction may be your only real chance of survival.</p><p>Today, in these turbulent times of economic, social and technological transition, the ADHD adventurer&#x2019;s moment has come again, and you will meet many who are finding new frontiers as they travel, explore and discover.</p><p>These next pages will challenge the standard view that individuals must suppress their adventurous natures and attempt to squeeze into our ever-narrowing definition of what is defined as normal by focusing on the many positives of a condition that, for many, has contributed to the unique position they hold in the world today. We need to recognize, embrace and skillfully use the best of this ADHD trait, not manage or stifle or &#x201c;normalize&#x201d; the very qualities that could define our next generation&#x2019;s leaders.</p><p>This book explodes the myth that ADHD is a problem that needs to be fixed. Of course, many do struggle with the &#x201c;symptoms,&#x201d; and need treatment. Yes, there is a flip side to some of these strengths in the absence of self-awareness and the use of certain strategies to overcome the weaknesses. But for too long, educators and mental health experts have been overdiagnosing and overprescribing to the detriment of our nation&#x2019;s children. It&#x2019;s a fact that&#x2019;s only just beginning to get recognition from former proponents of stimulant use among members of the medical community.</p><p>In the spring of 2014, Dr. Keith Conners, who was among the first physicians to legitimize ADHD as a diagnosis, called our surging diagnosis and prescription rates &#x201c;a national disaster of dangerous proportions.&#x201d;</p><p>ADHD diagnoses have been climbing exponentially. Statistics vary depending on which study you cite, but in the United States the National Center for Health Statistics reports that 6.4 million American kids (11 percent) ages three through seventeen have been diagnosed. Even more disturbing is the number of children now on medication for ADHD: 3.5 million; up from 600,000 in 1990, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p>&#x201c;The numbers make it look like an epidemic,&#x201d; Dr. Conners told the<i> New York Times</i>. &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s not. It&#x2019;s preposterous. This is a concoction to justify the giving out of medications at unprecedented and unjustifiable levels.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Honor dies where conflict of interest lies,&#x201d; says Dr. Allen Frances, a professor emeritus at Duke University and the former chairman of the <i>DSM-IV</i> Task Force (<i>DSM</i> referring to <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>, which you will be hearing more about in the coming pages). Dr. Frances, one of the most respected experts in this field, has expressed his outrage at how closely tied the so-called...</p></p><h2>The Tale of Urso Brunov: Little Father of All Bears</h2><p>Urso Brunov or Little Father, a bear the size of a thumb, saves a group of animals from a misguided baggy-trousered crybaby known as the Lord of all Sands. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Brian Jacques lives in Liverpool, England. Alexi Natchev lives in Newark, Delaware.Kindergarten-Grade 3-This long-winded faux folktale concerns "a tribe of bears called the Brunov" who are "only the size of your thumb!" One year, four little bears set out in search of sunshine and warmth instead of staying safely at home and sleeping through the winter. So, Urso Brunov, the "Little Father of All Bears," has to rescue them. His trip takes him from snowy woods to high mountains and dry deserts. He meets other animals (normal sized) and tricks, bullies, or cajoles them into helping him. Urso discovers the bears and many other animals trapped in a zoo. He rescues them all and leaves the guards and their leader imprisoned in the cages. Jacques's plot has a traditional folktale pattern and his choice of language and the frequent use of repetition (particularly the protagonist's admonition that others should "Believe me, for I am Urso Brunov!") enhance this feel. Urso is a typical folktale hero, plucky, brave, self-confident, and successful. Unfortunately, the very predictability of the story, along with its length, may make it difficult for the book to find an appreciative audience. Children young enough to enjoy Natchev's richly colored and beautifully composed paintings may find it hard to sit through the lengthy text, while older fans of the author's work will likely be disappointed by the slim story.<br><i>Lisa Dennis, The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, PA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Akiva: Life, Legend, Legacy</h2><p>The legendary Akiva ben Yosef has fascinated Jews for centuries. Arguably the most important of the Tannaim, or early Jewish sages, Akiva lived during a crucial era in the development of Judaism as we know it today, and his theology played a major part in the development of Rabbinic Judaism. Reuven Hammer details Akiva&#x2019;s life as it led to a martyr&#x2019;s death and he delves into the rich legacy Akiva left us.<br><br> That legacy played an extraordinarily important role in helping the Jewish people survive difficult challenges to forge a vibrant religious life anew, and it continues to influence Jewish law, ethics, and theology even today. Akiva&#x2019;s contribution to the development of Oral Torah cannot be overestimated, and in this first book written in English about the sage since 1936 Hammer reassesses Akiva&#x2019;s role from the period before the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE until the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE. He also assesses new findings about the growth of early Judaism, the reasons why Akiva was so outspoken about &#x201c;Christian Jews,&#x201d; the influence of Hellenism, the Septuagint, and the canonization of the Hebrew Bible. Ultimately Hammer shows that Judaism without Akiva would be a very different religion.&nbsp;</p><p><p>Rabbi Reuven Hammer is the former director and dean of the Jerusalem branch of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS), where he served as a professor of Rabbinic literature. He holds a Doctor of Humane Letters from JTS and a PhD from Northwestern University and&nbsp;was also the founding director of the Seminary of Jewish Studies. He is the author or editor of many books, including <i>Entering the High Holy Days: A Complete Guide to the History, Prayers, and Themes</i> (JPS, 2005) and <i>Sifre: A Taanaitic Commentary on the Book of Deuteronomy</i>, both of which are National Jewish Book Award winners.</p><p><br> &nbsp;</p>"Hammer performs a delicate balancing act&#x2014;not only between deciding between fact and legend, but in showing the struggles within the rabbinic community. Readers looking to learn more about Akiva and the growth of rabbinic Judaism will find his work has much to offer."&#x2014;Rabbi Rachel Esserman, <i>Reporter Group</i> (Rabbi Rachel Esserman <i>Reporter Group</i>)<br><br>"Hammer is to be heartily congratulated for producing yet another book to be added to his list of prodigious publications."&#x2014;Shalom M.

Faye Kellerman<br><br>Despite five centuries of investigation by historians, the sinister deaths of the boy king Edward V and his younger brother Richard, Duke of York, remain one of the most fascinating murder mysteries in English history. Did Richard III really kill the young princes, as is commonly believed, or was the murderer someone else entirely?

These sources include the account of Dominic Mancini, an Italian monk who was in England from 1482-July 1483 as part of a French delegation and the Croyland Chronicles. Other writers, including novelists Josephine Tey and Sharon Kay Penmann, have examined the disappearance of Edward V and his younger brother. I won't tell you Weir's conclusions, but I will say that she is very persuasive in her reasoning. I highly recommend PRINCES IN THE TOWER to any fans of British Royal history.<br><br>Randy Hickernell, Ballantine Sales Rep1espite five centuries of investigation by historians, the sinister deaths of the boy king Edward V and his younger brother Richard, Duke of York, remain one of the most fascinating murder mysteries in English history. Did Richard III really kill "the Princes in the Tower," as is commonly believed, or was the murderer someone else entirely?<p>In this utterly absorbing and meticulously researched book, English writer Alison Weir, an authority on the history of the British royal family, at last provides a conclusive solution to this age-old puzzle. Carefully examining every shred of contemporary evidence as well as the dozens of modern accounts, Weir reconstructs the entire chain of events leading to the double murder.</p><p>In The Princes in the Tower we are witnesses to the tumultuous reign of Edward IV, the princes' powerful, handsome, promiscuous father. We see the unfolding rivalry between the Wydvilles, the common family of Edward's shrewd queen, and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, his ambitious brother. Finally we are swept up in the vortex of intrigue that followed Edward's death - the naming of his twelve-year-old son Edward as heir; Richard's swift arrival in London and his lightning strike for power; the imprisonment of the princes in the Tower of London; and the hushed-up murders that secured Richard's claim to the throne as Richard III.</p><p>Weir considers in turn each of the prime suspects in the murder: the grasping, conspiratorial Duke of Buckingham; the shadowy Sir James Tyrell, Richard's trusted retainer; the possibility that the boys may have died of natural causes; and of course, Richard III himself, a complex man of charm and intelligence twisted by a ruthless ambition for power.</p><p>More than an historical murder mystery, The Princes in the Tower is a richly detailed tapestry of English court life in the late fifteenth century - the bitter rivalries that exploded in the Wars of the Roses; the splendor and corruption of the royal family; the violence and treachery that coexisted with exquisite beauty and refinement. At the very center of that tapestry is the tragic image of two pale, innocent, bewildered boys, an image that has haunted our minds for half a millennium. Powerfully written, persuasively argued, and totally mesmerizing to read, The Princes in the Tower is at once a masterpiece of historical research and a riveting story of conspiracy, murder, and deception.</p></p><h2>On Having No Head: Zen and the Rediscovery of the Obvious</h2><p>&#34;Headlessness&#34;, the feeling of no self that mystics of all times have aspired to, is an instantaneous way of &#34;waking up&#34; and becoming more aware of oneself and the world. Douglas Harding&#39;s description of his first experience of headlessness, a work first published in 1961, has now been revised.

She sees a similar process at work in the case of AIDS, the modern epidemic that has called forth metaphors of plague, implacable viral invaders, a scourge from the Third World. Such metaphors foster the stigmatizing of AIDS patients while spreading misinformation and panic, she argues, further claiming that clinical reports on the course of AIDS from "fledgling" to "full-blown" tacitly support the far-from-proven theory that everyone who tests positive for the AIDS antibody will die of the diease. The theory that AIDS originated in Africa, also unproven, feeds into the West's political paranoia and activates racial and sexual stereotypes. Regrettably, Sontag all but ignores intravenous drug users stricken with AIDS, and her curt dismissal of alternative therapies is shortsighted. Though some of her key points are already standard features of public discourse, this brief, brilliant essay discounts many of the fears and illusions surrounding the pandemic. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall</h2><p>An international expert presents an analysis of why and how nations make business decisions while demonstrating how the U.S. can best act in its own interests, revealing how the examples of Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro can inform us about North Korea&#39;s Kim Jong-il, the role America should take in strengthening China&#39;s economy, and the importance of acting in Saudi Arabia before it is broken apart. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>Ian Bremmer is president of Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.<b>CHAPTER ONE<p></p><p>Stability, Openness,</p></b><p><b>and the J Curve</b></p><p></p><p>On February 10, 2005, North Korea's state-run Pyongyang Radio informed its captive audience that the president of the United States had developed a plan to engulf the world in a sea of flames and to rule the planet through the forced imposition of freedom. In self-defense, the newsreader continued, North Korea had manufactured nuclear weapons.</p><p></p><p>That evening, Rick Nieman of the Netherlands' RTL Television asked U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to respond to Pyongyang's assertion that North Korea needed nuclear weapons to cope with "the Bush administration's ever more undisguised policy to isolate...the Democratic People's Republic of Korea." Rice countered: "This is a state that has been isolated completely for its entire history.... They have been told that if they simply make the decision...to give up their nuclear weapons and nuclear-weapons program, to dismantle them verifiably and irreversibly, there is a completely new path available to them.... So the North Koreans should reassess this and try to end their own isolation."</p><p></p><p>That's the official U.S. policy on North Korea: If North Korea submits to the complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear program, Washington will end North Korea's isolation and support the integration of Kim Jong-Il's regime into the international community. If, on the other hand, North Korea persists in developing its nuclear capacity, Washington will "further deepen North Korea's isolation."</p><p></p><p>To many, this policy is grounded in common sense. If North Korea begins to behave as Washington wants, the United States should reward the regime. If it does not, Washington should further seal it off. If Kim will quiet the relentless drumbeat of war and renounce his campaign to build an arsenal of the world's most destructive weapons, Washington should allow North Korea to escape its wretched isolation. If, on the other hand, North Korea insists on causing trouble, bargains in bad faith, ratchets up tensions in East Asia, violates its agreements, and perhaps even sells the world's most dangerous weapons to the world's most dangerous people, the regime must be swiftly and soundly punished. Kim Jong-Il and those who administer his government must be persuaded that his broken promises and misdeeds doom his regime to perpetual quarantine.</p><p></p><p>If this policy is properly applied, so the thinking goes, the message will be received far beyond North Korea. Common sense demands that Washington demonstrate that America stands ready to achieve its foreign- and security-policy goals with the sweetest carrots and sharpest sticks available. So the thinking goes.</p><p></p><p>But, as we'll see in the next chapter, this approach has failed to help Washington achieve its goals in North Korea. In fact, it has produced policies that have had virtually the opposite of their intended effects. Of course, U.S. foreign policies that produce the reverse of their intended consequences are not limited to either North Korea or the George W. Bush administration. Policy failures over many decades in Iraq, Iran, Cuba, Russia, and many other states demonstrate that policymakers need an entirely new geopolitical framework, one that captures the way decision-makers within these states calculate their interests and make their choices -- and one that offers insight into how more effective U.S. policies can be formulated.</p><p></p><p>There is a counterintuitive relationship between a nation's stability and its openness, both to the influences of the outside world and within its borders. Certain states -- North Korea, Burma, Belarus, Zimbabwe -- are stable precisely because they are closed. The slightest influence on their citizens from the outside could push the most rigid of these states toward dangerous instability. If half the people of North Korea saw twenty minutes of CNN (or of Al Jazeera for that matter), they would realize how egregiously their government lies to them about life beyond the walls. That realization could provoke widespread social upheaval. The slightest improvement in the ability of a country's citizens to communicate with one another -- the introduction of telephones, e-mail, or text-messaging into an authoritarian state -- can likewise undermine the state's monopoly on information.</p><p></p><p>Other states -- the United States, Japan, Sweden -- are stable because they are invigorated by the forces of globalization. These states are able to withstand political conflict, because their citizens -- and international investors -- know that political and social problems within them will be peacefully resolved by institutions that are independent of one another and that the electorate will broadly accept the resolution as legitimate. The institutions, not the personalities, matter in such a state.</p><p></p><p>Yet, for a country that is "stable because it's closed" to become a country that is "stable because it's open," it must go through a transitional period of dangerous instability. Some states, like South Africa, survive that journey. Others, like Yugoslavia, collapse. Both will be visited in Chapter Four. It is more important than ever to recognize the dangers implicit in these processes. In a world of lightning-fast capital flight, social unrest, weapons of mass destruction, and transnational terrorism, these transformations are everybody's business.</p><p></p><p>The J curve is a tool designed to help policymakers develop more insightful and effective foreign policies. It's meant to help investors understand the risks they face as they invest abroad. It's also intended to help anyone curious about international politics better understand how leaders make decisions and the impact of those decisions on the global order. As a model of political risk, the J curve can help us predict how states will respond to political and economic shocks, and where their vulnerabilities lie as globalization erodes the stability of authoritarian states.</p><p></p><p>J curves aren't new to models of political and economic behavior. In the 1950s, James Davies developed a quite different curve that expressed the dangers inherent in a gap between a people's rising economic expectations and their actual circumstances. Another J curve measured the relationship between a state's trade deficit and the value of its currency. The purpose of the J curve in this book is quite different and much broader. It is intended to describe the political and economic forces that revitalize some states and push others toward collapse.</p><p></p><p>What is the J curve? Imagine a graph on which the vertical axis measures stability and the horizontal axis measures political and economic openness to the outside world. Each nation whose level of stability and openness we want to measure appears as a data point on the graph. These data points, taken together, produce a J shape. Nations to the left of the dip in the J are less open; nations to the right are more open. Nations higher on the graph are more stable; those that are lower are less stable.</p><p></p><p>In general, the stability of countries on the left side of the J curve depends on individual leaders -- Stalin, Mao, Idi Amin. The stability of states on the right side of the curve depends on institutions -- parliaments independent of the executive, judiciaries independent of both, nongovernmental organizations, labor unions, citizens' groups. Movement from left to right along the J curve demonstrates that a country that is stable because it is closed must go through a period of dangerous instability as it opens to the outside world. There are no shortcuts, because authoritarian elites cannot be quickly replaced with institutions whose legitimacy is widely accepted.</p><p></p><p>"Openness" is a measure of the extent to which a nation is in harmony with the crosscurrents of globalization -- the processes by which people, ideas, information, goods, and services cross international borders at unprecedented speed. How many books written in a foreign language are translated into the local language? What percentage of a nation's citizens have access to media outlets whose signals originate from beyond their borders? How many are able to make an international phone call? How much direct contact do local people have with foreigners? How free are a nation's citizens to travel abroad? How much foreign direct investment is there in the country? How much local money is invested outside the country? How much cross-border trade exists? There are many more such questions.</p><p></p><p>But openness also refers to the flow of information and ideas <i>within</i> a country's borders. Are citizens free to communicate with one another? Do they have access to information about events in other regions of the country? Are freedoms of speech and assembly legally established? How transparent are the processes of local and national government? Are there free flows of trade across regions within the state? Do citizens have access to, and influence in, the processes of governance?</p><p></p><p>"Stability" has two crucial components: the state's capacity to withstand shocks and its ability to avoid producing them. A nation is only unstable if both are absent. Saudi Arabia remains stable because, while it has produced numerous shocks over the last decade, it remains capable of riding out the tremors. The House of Saud is likely to continue to absorb political shocks without buckling for at least the next several years. Kazakhstan is stable for the opposite reason. Its capacity to withstand a major political earthquake is questionable but, over the course of its fifteen-year history as a sovereign state, it hasn't created its own political crises. How Kazakhstan might withstand a near-term political shock, should one occur, is far more open to question than in Saudi Arabia, where the real stability challenges are much longer-term.</p><p></p><p>To illustrate how countries with varying levels of stability react to a similar shock, consider the following: An election is held to choose a head of state. A winner is announced under circumstances challenged by a large number of voters. The nation's highest judicial body generates con...</p></p><h2>The Mystical Tarot</h2><p>A comprehensive, step-by-step introduction to the Tarot presents easy-to-understand illustrations and diagrams; complete instructions on how to lay out, read, and interpret the cards; a history of the Tarot; and other features for both beginners and advanced users.

For centuries, the saint&#39;s name was held in such reverence that the Irish would only call themselves Gilpatrick, which means &#39;servant of Patrick&#39;. It was the one and only English Pope who first told the English King to conquer Christian Ireland in the Middle Ages. St Stephen&#39;s Green is the well-known centre of fashionable Dublin and is named after a small leper hospital that used to be there; Leopardstown racecourse is so-called because the land it is on also belonged to a leper hospital.

In this book, Goldwater offered a clear warning about impending dangers to the survival of our American freedoms with recommendations of appropriate action to avoid those dangers. Had Goldwater been elected, we might find today&#39;s political landscape very different. This book explores the perils of power, States rights, Civil rights, taxes and spending, and perhaps the most important, the welfare state.

Buchanan.</p><p>Here is the path-breaking book that rocketed a political philosophy into the forefront of the nation's consciousness, written in words whose vigor and relevance have not tarnished with age:</p><p>I have little interest in streamlining government or in making it more efficient, for I mean to reduce its size. I do not undertake to promote welfare, for I propose to extend freedom. My aim is not pass laws, but to repeal them. it is not to inaugurate new programs, but to cancel old ones that do violence to the Constitution, or that have failed in their purpose, or that impose on the people an unwarranted financial burden. I will not attempt to discover whether legislation is "needed" before I have first determined whether it is constitutionally permissible.

She woke with a bad hangover, a damp dog crushing her and the demented pounding of drums and cymbals coming from her son's bedroom. To add to her gloom, it was pelting with rain outside.She lay still for a moment, gathering her thoughts. She had a chiropody appointment for a painful corn and a client she loathed would be in her office in just over two hours. It was going to be one of those days, she had the feeling, when things just kept on getting worse. Like the drumming.'Tyler!' she yelled. 'For Christ's sake, stop that. Are you ready?'Otis leapt off the bed and began barking furiously at his reflection in the mirror on the wall.The drumming fell silent.She staggered to the bathroom, found the paracetamols and gulped two down. I am so not a good example to my son, she thought. I'm not even a good example to my dog.As if on cue, Otis padded into the bathroom, holding his lead in his mouth expectantly.'What's for breakfast, Mum?' Tyler called out.She stared at herself in the bathroom mirror. Mercifully, most of her forty-one-year-old - and this morning going on 241-year-old - face was shrouded in a tangle of blonde hair that looked, at this moment, like matted straw.'Arsenic!' she shouted back, her throat raw from too many cigarettes last night. 'Laced with cyanide and rat poison.'Otis stamped his paw on the bathroom tiles.'Sorry, no walkies. Not this morning. Later. OK?''I had that yesterday!' Tyler shouted back.'Well, it didn't sodding work, did it?'She switched on the shower, waited for it to warm up, then stepped inside.DEAD MAN'S GRIP.

He has been a professional chef for over two decades. His work has appeared in The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Times, The Observer, Scotland on Sunday, The Face, Limb by Limb, Black Book and The Independent. He is a contributing authority for Food Arts magazine. He lives in New York City with his wife, Nancy.For his second course, Bourdain, novelist (Bone in the Throat, 1995) and chef (at Sullivan's, in Manhattan), dishes up a sorry, soggy mess of a stew in which a good-hearted hit man finds himself on the spot with both mob chieftains and law-enforcement agencies. Hired by an ambitious cross-dressing mafioso named Pazz Calabrese to eliminate his two immediate superiors, Henry Denard dispatches one but only wounds the other, D'Andrea (Donnie Wicks) Balistierian aging capo di tutti capi in New York. After returning to Saint Martin, the idyllic West Indian haven he calls home, the hired gun (a decorated Vietnam vet who went on to work for the CIA) learns his wounded target has turned informant and will testify against former partners in crime. What's more, an accommodating interpretation of the Witness Protection Act allows Donnie Wicks (and a small army of US marshals) to take up residence on Saint Martin. Concerned that he and his hardcase wife Frances may have to find another place to live, Henry talks his way inside the former don's compound for a meet. Not to worry, the elderly outlaw has the nothing-personal aspect of gangdom's business down pat, and he soon takes a shine to the professional killer as well as to his lovely, lethal lady. In the meantime, the expatriate godfather's former underlings mount a deadly campaign to silence him. In the wake of a furious assault on his island home (which costs six feds and a like number of Dominican nationals their lives), Donnie Wicks (now under the protection of venal French officials) is reported dead. As a favor to the American authorities cheated of a show trial, Henry heads north to waste the kinky Calabrese and his top lieutenants with a light anti-tank weapon on a New Jersey construction site. At the close, he's drinking and living it up with Frances and Donnie Wicks at his Caribbean hideaway. In the parlance of cuisine: tripe. (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

As Clifford Pickover briefly recounts in this enthralling book, the most comprehensive in decades on magic squares, Emperor Yu was supposedly strolling along the Yellow River one day around 2200 B.C. when he spotted the creature: its shell had a series of dots within squares. To Yu's amazement, each row of squares contained fifteen dots, as did the columns and diagonals. When he added any two cells opposite along a line through the center square, like 2 and 8, he always arrived at 10. The turtle, unwitting inspirer of the ''Yu'' square, went on to a life of courtly comfort and fame.</p><br><p> Pickover explains why Chinese emperors, Babylonian astrologer-priests, prehistoric cave people in France, and ancient Mayans of the Yucatan were convinced that magic squares--arrays filled with numbers or letters in certain arrangements--held the secret of the universe. Since the dawn of civilization, he writes, humans have invoked such patterns to ward off evil and bring good fortune. Yet who would have guessed that in the twenty-first century, mathematicians would be studying magic squares so immense and in so many dimensions that the objects defy ordinary human contemplation and visualization?</p><br><p> Readers are treated to a colorful history of magic squares and similar structures, their construction, and classification along with a remarkable variety of newly discovered objects ranging from ornate inlaid magic cubes to hypercubes. Illustrated examples occur throughout, with some patterns from the author's own experiments. The tesseracts, circles, spheres, and stars that he presents perfectly convey the age-old devotion of the math-minded to this Zenlike quest. Number lovers, puzzle aficionados, and math enthusiasts will treasure this rich and lively encyclopedia of one of the few areas of mathematics where the contributions of even nonspecialists count.</p></p><p>"Clifford Pickover has compiled such a wonderfully voluminous collection of magic squares and related configurations that the physical book itself threatens to take the shape of a magic cube. Whether or not you achieve arithmetical satori contemplating these engagingly intricate patterns, you will surely come to appreciate their history, beauty, and richness." <p> -- John Allen Paulos, author of Innumeracy and A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper, mathematics professor at Temple University "At first glance magic squares may seem frivolous (Ben Franklin's opinion, even as he spent countless hours studying them!), but I think that is wrong. The great 19th century German mathematician Leopold Kronecker said 'God Himself made the whole numbers - everything else is the work of men,' and Cliff Pickover's stimulating book hints strongly at the possibility that God may have done more with the integers than just create them.

Inside Out, QPB, &amp; Reader's Subscription.</p><p><i>Dear Friends: American Photographs of Men Together, 1840-1918</i> collects more than 100 portraits--from daguerreotypes to <i>cartes des visites</i> and early photographic postcards--depicting affectionate male friendships whose precise nature, whether platonic or sexual, will never be known. Editor David Deitcher, who teaches art and critical theory at the Cooper Union, reflects on the history of these images and their possible significance. In the late Victorian period, he notes, men commonly established intimate, passionate friendships with other men, and often "posed for photographers holding hands, entwining limbs, or resting in the shelter of each other's accommodating bodies, innocent of the suspicion that such behavior would later arouse." These photographs have long been collected by gay men, for whom they are vehicles of longing "for the self-validation that comes from having a history to refer to; longing for a comforting sense of connection with others--past as well as present--whose experience mirrors one's own." Nevertheless, Deitcher reminds readers, because almost all the subjects of these photographs are anonymous, "they are powerless to communicate anything more than the following: This is how these men looked on that day when they sat for the photographer." But what these photographs prove is ultimately far less interesting or engaging than what they <i>are</i>: tender, funny, strange relics of a time when public expressions of love between men were freer and more natural than they are in our own ostensibly more liberated age. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>DAVID DEITCHER is a writer, art historian, and critic whose essays have appeared in Artforum, Art in America, and other periodicals, as well as in numerous books. He was the editor of The Question of Equality: Lesbian and Gay Politics in America Since Stonewall.

And here's what you can do about it on Monday morning with the definitive how-to book from the world's leading authority on innovation <p>When it comes to innovation, Curt Carlson and Bill Wilmot of SRI International know what they are talking about--literally. SRI has pioneered innovations that day in and day out are part of the fabric of your life, such as: <br>-The computer mouse and the personal computer interface you use at home and work <br>-The high-definition television in your living room <br>-The unusual numbers at the bottom of your checks that enable your bank to maintain your account balance correctly <br>-The speech-recognition system used by your financial services firm when you call for your account balance or to make a transaction. <br>Each of these innovations--and literally hundreds of others--created new value for customers. And that's the central message of this book. Innovation is not about inventing clever gadgets or just -creativity.- It is the successful creation and delivery of a new or improved product or service that provides value for your customer and sustained profit for your organization. The first black-and-white television, for example, was just an interesting, cool invention until David Sarnoff created an innovation--a network--that delivered programming to an audience. <br>The genius of this book is that it provides the -how- of innovation. It makes innovation practical by getting two groups who are often disconnected--the managers who make decisions and the people on the front lines who create the innovations--onto the same page. Instead of smart people grousing about the executive suite not recognizing a good idea if they tripped over it and the folks on the top floor wondering whether the people doing the complaining have an understanding of market realities, Carlson and Wilmot's five disciplines of innovation focus attention where it should be: on the creation of valuable new products and services that meet customer needs. <br><i>Innovation</i> is not just for the -lone genius in the garage- but for you and everyone in your enterprise. Carlson and Wilmot provide a systematic way to make innovation practical, one intimately tied to the way things get done in your business. </p><p>Teamwork isn't enough; Creativity isn't enough; A new product idea isn't enough <br>True innovation is about delivering value to customers. Innovation reveals the value-creating processes used by SRI International, the organization behind the computer mouse, robotic surgery, and the domain names .com, .org, and .gov. Curt Carlson and Bill Wilmot show you how to use these practical, tested processes to create great customer value for your organization.</p></p><p>" Innovation -- mystery or mastery?

WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS, BUT WE WILL DIRECT YOU TOWARDS A VARIETY OF USEFUL IDEAS THAT ARE GUARANTEED TO STIMULATE, PROVOKE, AND CONSOLE. </p><p><b>We don't think too much about sex; we're merely thinking about it in the wrong way.</b> <br>So asserts Alain de Botton in <i>How to Think More About Sex</i>, a rigorous and supremely honest book designed to help us navigate the intimate and exciting---yet often confusing and difficult---experience that is sex. Few of us tend to feel we're entirely normal when it comes to sex, and what we're supposed to be feeling rarely matches up with the reality. This book argues that twenty-first-century sex is ultimately fated to be a balancing act between love and desire, and adventure and commitment. Covering topics that include lust, fetishism, adultery, and pornography, Alain de Botton frankly articulates the dilemmas of modern sexuality, offering insights and consolation to help us think more deeply and wisely about the sex we are, or aren't, having.</p></p><p><b>Alain de Botton</b> is the bestselling author of <i>How Proust Can Change Your Life,</i> as well as numerous other works of fiction and essays. He is well-known for making complex philosophical and artistic subjects accessible for a wider audience. De Botton founded the School of Life, a series of lectures in London that aim to make academic learning applicable to real life. With the success of the school, this concept was adapted into The School of Life book series. De Botton lives and works in London.<p>Introduction</p> <p>It is rare to get through this life without feeling� generally with a degree of secret agony, perhaps at the end of a relationship, or as we lie in bed frustrated next to our partner, unable to go to sleep� that we are somehow a bit odd about sex. It is an area in which most of us have a painful impression, in our heart of hearts, that we are quite unusual. Despite being one of the most private of activities, sex is nonetheless surrounded by a range of powerful socially sanctioned ideas that codify how normal people are meant to feel about and deal with the matter.</p> <p>In truth, however, few of us are remotely normal sexually. We are almost all haunted by guilt and neuroses, by phobias and disruptive desires, by indifference and disgust. None of us approaches sex as we are meant to, with the cheerful, sporting, non-obsessive, constant, well-adjusted outlook that we torture ourselves by believing that other people are endowed with. We are universally deviant - but only in relation to some highly distorted ideals of normality.</p> <p>Given how common it is to be strange, it is regrettable how seldom the realities of sexual life make it into the public realm. Most of what we are sexually remains impossible to communicate with anyone whom we would want to think well of us. Men and women in love will instinctively hold back from sharing more than a fraction of their desires out of a fear, usually accurate, of generating intolerable disgust in their partners. We may find it easier to die without having had certain conversations.</p> <p>The priority of a philosophical book about sex seems evident: not to teach us how to have more intense or more frequent sex, but rather to suggest how, through a shared language, we might begin to feel a little less painfully strange about the sex we are either longing to have or struggling to avoid.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>2.</p> <p>Whatever discomfort we do feel around sex is commonly aggravated by the idea that we belong to a liberated age - and ought by now, as a result, to be finding sex a straightforward and untroubling matter.</p> <p>The standard narrative of our release from our shackles goes something like this: for thousands of years across the globe, due to a devilish combination of religious bigotry and pedantic social custom, people were afflicted by a gratuitous sense of confusion and guilt around sex. They thought their hands would fall off if they masturbated. They believed they might be burned in a vat of oil because they had ogled someone's ankle. They had no clue about erections or clitorises. They were ridiculous.</p> <p>Then, sometime between the First World War and the launch of <i>Sputnik 1</i>, things changed for the better. Finally, people started wearing bikinis, admitted to masturbating, grew able to mention cunnilingus in social contexts, started to watch porn films and became deeply comfortable with a topic that had, almost unaccountably, been the source of needless neurotic frustration for most of human history. Being able to enter into sexual relations with confidence and joy became as common an expectation for the modern era as feeling trepidation and guilt had been for previous ages. Sex came to be perceived as a useful, refreshing and physically reviving pastime, a little like tennis - something that everyone should have as often as possible in order to relieve the stresses of modern life.</p> <p>This narrative of enlightenment and progress, however flattering it may be to our powers of reason and our pagan sensibilities, conveniently skirts an unbudging fact: sex is not something that we can ever expect to feel easily liberated <i>from</i>. It was not by mere coincidence that sex so disturbed us for thousands of years: repressive religious dictates and social taboos grew out of aspects of our nature that cannot now just be wished away. We were bothered by sex because it is a fundamentally disruptive, overwhelming and demented force, strongly at odds with the majority of our ambitions and all but incapable of being discreetly integrated within civilized society.</p> <p>Despite our best efforts to clean it of its peculiarities, sex will never be either simple or <i>nice</i> in the ways we might like it to be. It is not fundamentally democratic or kind; it is bound up with cruelty, transgression and the desire for subjugation and humiliation. It refuses to sit neatly on top of love, as it should. Tame it though we may try, sex has a recurring tendency to wreak havoc across our lives: it leads us to destroy our relationships, threatens our productivity and compels us to stay up too late in nightclubs talking to people whom we don't like but whose exposed midriffs we nevertheless strongly wish to touch. Sex remains in absurd, and perhaps irreconcilable, conflict with some of our highest commitments and values. Unsurprisingly, we have no option but to repress its demands most of the time. We should accept that sex is inherently rather weird instead of blaming ourselves for not responding in more normal ways to its confusing impulses.</p> <p>This is not to say that we cannot take steps to grow wiser about sex. We should simply realize that we will never entirely surmount the difficulties it throws our way. Our best hope should be for a respectful accommodation with an anarchic and reckless power.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>HOW TO THINK MORE ABOUT SEX. Copyright � 2012 by The School of Life.

In the end, you can boil everything down to something similar&#x2014;or so Roberta Anderson thought much later on. It&#x2019;s either all an accident&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or all fate. Anderson literally stumbled over her destiny in the small town of Haven, Maine, on June 21, 1988. That stumble was the root of the matter; all the rest was nothing but history.<br> 2<p></p> <br>Anderson was out that afternoon with Peter, an aging beagle who was now blind in one eye. Peter had been given to her by Jim Gardener in 1976. Anderson had left college the year before with her degree only two months away to move onto her uncle&#x2019;s place in Haven. She hadn&#x2019;t realized how lonely she&#x2019;d been until Gard brought the dog. He&#x2019;d been a pup then, and Anderson sometimes found it difficult to believe he was now old&#x2014;eighty-four in dog&#x2019;s years. It was a way of measuring her own age. Nineteen-seventy-six had receded. Yes indeed. When you were twenty-five, you could still indulge in the luxury of believing that, in your case, at least, growing up was a clerical error which would eventually be rectified. When you woke up one day and discovered your dog was eighty-four and you yourself were thirty-seven, that was a view that had to be reexamined. Yes indeed.<br> <br>Anderson was looking for a place to cut some wood. She&#x2019;d a cord and a half laid by, but wanted at least another three to take her through the winter. She had cut a lot since those early days when Peter had been a pup sharpening his teeth on an old slipper (and wetting all too often on the dining-room rug), but the place was still not short. The property (still, after thirteen years, mostly referred to by the townspeople as the old Garrick place) had only a hundred and eighty feet on Route 9, but the rock walls marking the north and south boundaries marched off at diverging angles. Another rock wall&#x2014;this one so old it had degenerated into isolated rock middens furred with moss&#x2014;marked the property&#x2019;s rear boundary about three miles into an unruly forest of first-and second-growth trees. The total acreage of this pie-shaped wedge was huge. Beyond the wall at the western edge of Bobbi Anderson&#x2019;s land were miles of wilderness owned by the New England Paper Company. Burning Woods, on the map.<br> <br>In truth, Anderson didn&#x2019;t really need to hunt a place to do her cutting. The land her mother&#x2019;s brother had left her was valuable because most of the trees on it were good hardwood relatively untouched by the gypsy-moth infestation. But this day was lovely and warm after a rainy spring, the garden was in the ground (where most of it would rot, thanks to the rains), and it wasn&#x2019;t yet time to start the new book. So she had covered the typewriter and here she was with faithful old one-eyed Peter, rambling.<br> <br>There was an old logging road behind the farm, and she followed this almost a mile before striking off to the left. She was wearing a pack (a sandwich and a book in it for her, dog biscuits for Peter, and lots of orange ribbon to tie around the trunks of the trees she would want to cut as September&#x2019;s heat ebbed toward October) and a canteen. She had a Silva compass in her pocket. She had gotten lost on the property only once, and once was enough to last her forever. She had spent a terrible night in the woods, simultaneously unable to believe she had actually gotten lost on property she for Christ&#x2019;s sweet sake owned and sure she would die out here&#x2014;a possibility in those days, because only Jim would know she was missing, and Jim only came when you weren&#x2019;t expecting him. In the morning, Peter had led her to a stream, and the stream had led her back to Route 9, where it burbled cheerfully through a culvert under the tar only two miles from home. Nowadays she probably had enough woods savvy to find her way back to the road or to one of the rock walls bounding her land, but the key word was probably. So she carried a compass.<br> <br>She found a good stand of maple around three o&#x2019;clock. In fact, she had found several other good stands of wood, but this one was close to a path she knew, a path wide enough to accommodate the Tomcat. Come September 20th or so&#x2014;if someone didn&#x2019;t blow the world up in the meantime&#x2014;she would hook her sledge up to the Tomcat, drive in here, and do some cutting. Besides, she had walked enough for one day.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look good, Pete?&#x201d;<br> <br>Pete barked feebly, and Anderson looked at the beagle with a sadness so deep it surprised and disquieted her. Peter was done up. He seldom took after birds and squirrels and chipmunks and the occasional woodchuck these days; the thought of Peter running a deer was laughable. She would have to take a good many rest stops on the way back for him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and there had been a time, not that long ago (or so her mind stubbornly maintained), when Peter would always have been a quarter of a mile ahead of her, belling volleys of barks back through the woods. She thought there might come a day when she would decide enough was enough; she&#x2019;d pat the seat on the passenger side of the Chevrolet pickup for the last time, and take Peter to the vet down in Augusta. But not this summer, please God. Or this fall or winter, please God. Or ever, please God.<br> <br>Because without Peter, she would be alone. Except for Jim, and Jim Gardener had gotten more than just a trifle wiggy over the last eight years or so. Still a friend, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wiggy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Glad you approve, Pete old man,&#x201d; she said, putting a ribbon or two around the trees, knowing perfectly well she might decide to cut another stand and the ribbons would rot here. &#x201c;Your taste is only exceeded by your good looks.&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter, knowing what was expected of him (he was old, but not stupid), wagged his scraggy stub of a tail and barked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Be a Viet Cong!&#x201d; Anderson ordered.<br> <br>Peter obediently fell on his side&#x2014;a little wheeze escaped him&#x2014;and rolled on his back, legs splayed out. That almost always amused Anderson, but today the sight of her dog playing Viet Cong (Peter would also play dead at the words &#x201c;hooch&#x201d; or &#x201c;My Lai&#x201d;) was too close to what she had been thinking about.<br> <br>&#x201c;Up, Pete.&#x201d;<br> <br>Pete got up slowly, panting below his muzzle. His white muzzle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go back.&#x201d; She tossed him a dog biscuit. Peter snapped at it and missed. He snuffed for it, missed it, then came back to it. He ate it slowly, without much relish. &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Anderson said. &#x201c;Move out.&#x201d;<br> 3<p></p> <br>For want of a shoe, the kingdom was lost&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the choice of a path, the ship was found.<br> <br>Anderson had been down here before in the thirteen years that the Garrick place hadn&#x2019;t become the Anderson place; she recognized the slope of land, a deadfall left by pulpers who had probably all died before the Korean War, a great pine with a split top. She had walked this land before and would have no trouble finding her way back to the path she would use with the Tomcat. She might have passed the spot where she stumbled once or twice or half a dozen times before, perhaps by yards, or feet, or bare inches.<br> <br>This time she followed Peter as the dog moved slightly to the left, and with the path in sight, one of her elderly hiking boots fetched up against something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fetched up hard.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; she yelled, but it was too late, in spite of her pinwheeling arms. She fell to the ground. The branch of a low bush scratched her cheek hard enough to bring blood.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shit!&#x201d; she cried, and a bluejay scolded her.<br> <br>Peter returned, first sniffing and then licking her nose.<br> <br>&#x201c;Christ, don&#x2019;t do that, your breath stinks!&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter wagged his tail. Anderson sat up. She rubbed her left cheek and saw blood on her palm and fingers. She grunted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice going,&#x201d; she said, and looked to see what she had tripped over&#x2014;a fallen piece of tree, most likely, or a rock poking out of the ground. Lots of rock in Maine.<br> <br>What she saw was a gleam of metal.<br> <br>She touched it, running her finger along it and then blowing off black forest dirt.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; she asked Peter.<br> <br>Peter approached, sniffed at it, and then did a peculiar thing. The beagle backed off two dog-paces, sat down, and uttered a single low howl.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who got on your case?&#x201d; Anderson asked, but Peter only sat there. Anderson hooked herself closer, still sitting down, sliding on the seat of her jeans. She examined the metal in the ground.<br> <br>Roughly three inches stuck out of the mulchy earth&#x2014;just enough to trip over. There was a slight rise here, and perhaps the runoff from the heavy spring rains had freed it. Anderson&#x2019;s first thought was that the skidders who had logged this land in the twenties and thirties must have buried a bunch of their leavings here&#x2014;the cast-off swill of a three-day cutting, which in those days had been called a &#x201c;loggers&#x2019; weekend.&#x201d;<br> <br>A tin can, she thought&#x2014;B&amp;M beans or Campbell&#x2019;s soup. She wiggled it the way you&#x2019;d wiggle a tin can out of the earth. Then it occurred to her that no one except a toddler would be apt to trip over the leading edge of a can. The metal in the earth didn&#x2019;t wiggle. It was as solid as mother-rock. A piece of old logging equipment, maybe?<br> <br>Intrigued, Anderson examined it more closely, not seeing that Peter had gotten to his feet, backed away another four paces, and sat down again.<br> <br>The metal was a dull gray&#x2014;not the bright color of tin or iron at all. And it was thicker than a can, maybe a quarter-inch at its top. Anderson placed the pad of her right index finger on this edge and felt a momentary odd tingling, like a vibration.<br> <br>She took her finger away and looked at it quizzically.<br> <br>Put it back.<br> <br>Nothing. No buzz.<br> <br>Now she pinched it between her thumb and finger and tried to draw it from the earth like a loose tooth from a gum. It didn&#x2019;t come. She was gripping the protrusion in the rough center. It sank back into the earth&#x2014;or that was the impression she had then&#x2014;on either side at a width of less than two inches. She would later tell Jim Gardener that she could have walked past it three times a day for forty years and never stumbled over it.<br> <br>She brushed away loose soil, exposing a little more of it. She dug a channel along it about two inches deep with her fingers&#x2014;the soil gave easily enough, as forest soil does&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at least until you hit the webwork of roots. It continued smoothly down into the ground. Anderson got up on her knees and dug down along either side. She tried wiggling it again. Still no go.<br> <br>She scraped away more soil with her fingers and quickly exposed more&#x2014;now she saw six inches of gray metal, now nine, now a foot.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a car or a truck or a skidder, she thought suddenly. Buried out here in the middle of nowhere. Or maybe a Hooverville kind of stove. But why here?<br> <br>No reason that she could think of; no reason at all. She found things in the woods from time to time&#x2014;shell casings, beer cans (the oldest not with pop-tops but with triangleshaped holes made by what they had called a &#x201c;churchkey&#x201d; back in those dim dead days of the 1960s), candy wrappers, other stuff. Haven was not on either of Maine&#x2019;s two major tourist tracks, one of which runs through the lake and mountain region to the extreme west of the state and the other of which runs up the coast to the extreme east, but it had not been the forest primeval for a long, long time. Once (she had been over the decayed stone wall at the back of her land and actually trespassing on New England Paper Company&#x2019;s land at the time) she had found the rusted hulk of a late-forties Hudson Hornet standing in what had once been a woods road and what was now, over twenty years after the cutting had stopped, a tangle of second growth&#x2014;what the locals called shit-wood. No reason that hulk of a car should have been there, either&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it was easier to explain than a stove or a refrigerator or any other damn thing actually buried in the ground.<br> <br>She had dug twin trenches a foot long on either side of the object without finding its end. She got down almost a foot before scraping her fingers on rock. She might have been able to pull the rock out&#x2014;that at least had some wiggle&#x2014;but there was no reason to do it. The object in the earth continued down past it.<br> <br>Peter whined.<br> <br>Anderson glanced at the dog, then stood up. Both knees popped. Her left foot tingled with pins and needles. She fished her pocket watch out of her pants&#x2014;old and tarnished, the Simon watch was another part of her legacy from Uncle Frank&#x2014;and was astonished to see that she had been here a long time: an hour and a quarter at least. It was past four.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Pete,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s bug out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter whined again but still wouldn&#x2019;t move. And now, with real concern, Anderson saw that her old beagle was shivering all over, as if with ague. She had no idea if dogs could catch ague, but thought old ones might. She did recollect that the only time she had ever seen Peter shiver like that was in the fall of 1977 (or maybe it had been &#x2019;78). There had been a catamount on the place. Over a series of perhaps nine nights it had screamed and squalled, very likely in unrequited heat. Each night Peter would go to the living-room window and jump up on the old church pew Anderson kept there by her bookcase. He never barked. He only looked out into the dark toward that unearthly, womanish squealing, nostrils flaring, ears up. And he shivered.<br> <br>Anderson stepped over her little excavation and went to Peter. She knelt down and ran her hands along the sides of Peter&#x2019;s face, feeling the shiver in her palms.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong, boy?&#x201d; she murmured, but she knew what was wrong. Peter&#x2019;s good eye shifted past her, toward the thing in the earth, and then back to Anderson. The plea in the eye not veiled by the hateful, milky cataract was as clear as speech: Let&#x2019;s get out of here, Bobbi, I like that thing almost as much as I like your sister.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Anderson said uneasily. It suddenly occurred to her that she could not remember ever having lost track of time as she had today, out here.<br> <br>Peter doesn&#x2019;t like it. I don&#x2019;t either.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on.&#x201d; She started up the slope to the path. Peter followed with alacrity.<br> <br>They were almost to the path when Anderson, like Lot&#x2019;s wife, looked back. If not for that last glance, she might actually have let the whole thing go. Since leaving college before finals&#x2014;in spite of her mother&#x2019;s tearful pleas and her sister&#x2019;s furious diatribes and baleful ultimatums&#x2014;Anderson had gotten good at letting things go.<br> <br>The look back from this middle distance showed her two things. First, the thing did not sink back into the earth as she had at first thought. The tongue of metal was sticking up in the middle of a fairly fresh declivity, not wide but fairly deep, and surely the result of late-winter runoff and the heavy spring rains that had followed it. So the ground to either side of the protruding metal was higher, and the metal simply disappeared back into it. Her first impression, that the thing in the ground was the corner of something, wasn&#x2019;t true after all&#x2014;or not necessarily true. Second, it looked like a plate&#x2014;not a plate you&#x2019;d eat from, but a dull metal plate...</p><h2>NAPOLEON: From 18 Brumaire to Tilsit 1799-1807</h2><p><p>With a new introduction by Andrew Roberts.</p> <p>'A penetrating interpretation...No one with a serious interest in the Napoleonic period can afford to ignore it. ' - <em>Times Literary Supplement</em></p> <p></p> <p>Whether viewed as an inspired leader or obsessed tyrant, Napoleon has divided opinion for over 200 years. Few individuals have left such a mark on history. Georges Lefebvre's classic work, published in Routledge Classics in one paperback volume in English for the first time, is a definitive portrait of the Napoleonic era.</p> <p></p> <p>Lefebvre&#x2019;s history sweeps us from the lightning coup d&#x2019;�tat of 18 Brumaire in 1799 to his final downfall amidst the wheatfields of Waterloo. More than a biography, it is a brilliant survey of the turbulent age Napoleon inaugurated in his attempt to redraw the map of Europe, from the Peninsular War to the invasion of Russia. The cast includes his antagonists &#x2013; Pitt the Younger, Wellington, Metternich and Tsar Alexander &#x2013; and his allies &#x2013; the wily Minister of Police Fouch� and Talleyrand, the &#x2018;Prince of Diplomats&#x2019;. Lefebvre&#x2019;s account is equally clear-eyed about Napoleon&#x2019;s genius and his flaws. Napoleon&#x2019;s determination to emulate Caesar and Augustus condemned Europe to more than a decade of war and economic crisis, but he also built an empire, introducing educational, administrative and financial initiatives that are still in place today.</p> <p>Georges Lefebvre (1877-1959) One of the foremost historians of the Twentieth Century and known as the &#x2018;historian&#x2019;s historian&#x2019;, he held the chair of the French Revolution at the Sorbonne .

From then on, we tend to base our relationship with Him on our performance rather than on His grace. Of course, God continues to deal with us on the basis of His grace, whether or not we understand it.

You&#x2019;ll never be able to ask for too much, need too much, hope for too much, or even sin too much.

Erica Langston&#39;s comfortable home and loving family living near Washington, D.C., carry no outward hint of the sorrows and fears faced by her Acadian forebears, but she will soon discover that similar determination and fortitude will be required of her. When the British once again invade the nation&#39;s capital and leave death and destruction in their wake, Erica is left to deal with the creditors circling around the crumbling family business. It seems her only recourse is to travel to England to collect on outstanding debts held in British banks. Arriving in London at the home of the United States ambassador, Erica is gradually immersed in a secret mission that brings her face-to-face with her most feared and reviled enemy. She discovers that Gereth Powers is part of a group of Christian activists headed up by William Wilberforce himself. Along the way, Erica comes to realize her faith has been more cultural than real, and her spiritual journey becomes far more signi?cant than her journey over the ocean.</p><p><p>A native North Carolinian who now lives abroad, T.

Narrator Amiee Lily captures the spirit of those turbulent times. The pacing is tight, the story laden with emotion and romance as Erica travels to Britain to collect gold held unjustly by the British Crown after the invasion. Lily switches from American to British upper and lower-class accents with deft skill. Although expertly narrated, the setting is 1812, when women didn't have the rights Erica takes for granted in her travels. This anachronism detracts from the story.

In minutes, the ship is ablaze (and doomed), and our seven luckless protagonists are adrift in two small boats. They make their way to land, only to find themselves captives of one of the last remaining pirates operating off the China Coast. But Missee Lee, as it turns out, is no ordinary pirate; her father had sent her off to Cambridge University to prepare her for a life as a teacher. But when he dies, she is forced to return and claim her place as rightful ruler. She finds herself struggling to hold together the Three Island Confederation he had created, and to be recognized as his legitimate heir and ruler of the Island Kingdom. &#x201c;Missee Lee, by Arthur Ransome, seems to be his best yet.

Many of us travel abroad, and few of us live in the towns or cities where we were born. It wasn't always so. Travel from America to Europe became a commonplace, an ordinary commodity, some time ago, but when I first went such departure was still surrounded with an atmosphere of adventure and improvisation, and my youth and inexperience and my all but complete lack of money heightened that vertiginous sensation,&#x201d; writes W. S. Merwin. Twenty-one, married and graduated from Princeton, the poet embarked on his first visit to Europe in 1948 when life and traditions on the continent were still adjusting to the postwar landscape. <i>Summer Doorways</i> captures Merwin at a similarly pivotal time before he won the Yale Younger Poets Award in 1952 for his first book, <i>A Mask for Janus</i> the moment was, as the author writes, an entire age just before it was gone, like a summer.&#x201d;</p><p><b>W. S. Merwin</b> is the author of more than forty books of poetry, prose, and translation, including <i>The Carrier of Ladders,</i> for which he received the Pulitzer Prize in poetry. He has been honored with the Bollingen Award, the first Tanning Award, the Ruth Lilly Prize, and many others. He has lived for many years in Hawaii.<br>In 34 brief, dreamy chapters, esteemed American poet and translator Merwin meanders back to the late 1940s and early 1950s summers of his youth and inexperience. At age 16, he was blessedly released from the watchful protection of his stern Presbyterian father in Scranton, Pa., to attend Princeton, when the university was bereft of young men serving in WWII. Through a Princeton acquaintance, Alain Pr�vost (son of French writer Jean Pr�vost), the impressionable young Merwin secured the position of tutor to Pr�vost's friend Alan Stuyvesant's nephew, Peter, and spent an idyllic summer at the eminent family's bucolic home, Deer Park, in Hackettstown, N.J. Over two summers with Alan's aristocratic family, first at Deer Park, then in St. Jean Cap-Ferrat, France, near Nice, the fledgling writer glimpsed for the first time "some ancient, measureless way of living." Upon graduating, he returned to Europe with his wife and two 12-year-olds he would tutor for the summer in the south of France. Merwin (<i>The Ends of the Earth</i>) is best at succinct, decisive cameos: characters enter his enchanted sphere, then vanish, such as the visiting young Samuel Beckett, memorable for the exquisite fineness of his cucumber slicing. Purposefully incomplete, occasionally frustrating, Merwin's book traces lost worlds. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The core of Immanuel Kant's argument remains relevant to the experience of ordinary men and women. He wished to strengthen, not undermine, belief in God and in the spiritual nature of humankind. <p>This 1763 essay is imporrtant in understanding the development of Kant's thought. It exposed the flaw in the Cartesian argument that the existence of a perfect being could be deduced from an idea or concept of such. Similarly, Kant saw the problem inherent in the Leibnizian view of a philosophical system modeled on mathematics: a philosopher who, like a mathematician, began with an arbitrary definition remained trapped in a circle of words. In <i>The One Possible Basis for a Demonstration of the Existence of God</i>, Kant diverged from the familiar forms of ontological argument. The result was a brilliant approach to divine being that anticipated his mature Critique of Pure Reason.</p><p>With this Bison Book edition, <i>The One Possible Basis</i> appears in paperback for the first time.

The characteristic understatement of her text, juxtaposed with the humorous mutterings of a quirky cast (delivered in cartoon balloons), breezily chronicles Quixote's hapless quest to "right all wrongs and protect all damsels." (Though Williams's rendition seems appropriate for the intended audience, literary purists may object on principle to the abridgement of such a venerable classic.) Here the would-be knight is rendered as quite the buffoon, as he prepares to tilt at windmills he mistakes for "giants" and battle two "armies" that are actually flocks of sheep. Time after time, Quixote and sidekick Sancho Panza are badly battered (the former is shown losing his ear and some teeth), but always brush themselves off and continue "on their way in search of new adventure worthy of so famous a knight and his faithful squire." A fun way to become acquainted with this masterpiece.

In lively prose bursting with anecdote, Charles Sprawson leads us into a watery world populated by lithe demi-Gods -- one that has obsessed humans from the ancient Greeks and Romans, to Yeats, Virginia Woolf, F. Scott Fitzgerald and David Hockney. <br><br>Original, enticing and dripping with references to literature, film, art and Olympic history, this cult swimming classic pays sparkling tribute to water and the cultural meanings we attach to it.</p><p>Charles Sprawson is an obsessional swimmer and diver. He recently swam the Hellespont.Sprawson, an English art dealer who swam the Hellespont, has produced a delightful, profound cultural and literary history of swimming, bathing and the social meanings of water from ancient Greece to the modern Olympics. Swimmers, he contends, frequently fall prey to delusions and neuroses spawned by their solitary training. Flaubert and Shelley had an "erotic, neurotic affinity with water"; Swinburne took a masochistic delight in being scraped by pebbles and pounded by waves; and novelist Baron Corvo (Frederick Rolfe), a passionate swimmer, bathed in "morbid self-admiration and absorption in a fantasy world." Sprawson deftly probes the differing values associated with swimming by various cultures. The English, who swam naked until the Victorian Age, saw bathing as a means of social reform. Germans from Goethe to Thomas Mann linked swimming to a Faustian quest for knowledge, to spiritual perfection and, in Leni Riefenstahl's films, to a cult of athleticism. In the U.S., according to Sprawson, swimming has been associated with refuge and withdrawal, citing as examples F. Scott Fitzgerald's fiction and David Hockney's paintings of Southern California. This invigorating excursion affords a fabulous dip with the likes of Poe, Byron, Virginia Woolf, Yukio Mishima, Esther Williams and Johnny Weissmuller.

In early 1920's when his works <i>Garden of Allah </i>and <i>Daybreak</i> were reproduced as art prints, he quickly became one of the best known artists in America. His unmistakable paintings&#x2014;characterized by 'Parrish Blue' water and skies, luminescent rocks and hills, and exquisite young women draped in flowing, classically inspired garments&#x2014;are infused with a romantic Eden-like quality so entrancing that today's reproductions elicit the same infectious enthusiasm as when the prints first appeared.<br>In the 1920's, one out of four American homes had his world of make-believe hanging on their walls. A survey taken in 1925 in America showed that Van Gogh, C�zanne and Parrish were thought to be the three greatest artists of all time and Parrish's art images on posters, calendars, magazine covers, and book illustrations have made his name a household word thereafter.<br>Today, Parrish's art works are in the collections of many museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard, and his work is once again experiencing an enthusiastic revival. Parrish's painting <i>Daybreak</i>, one of the most reproduced art images in history, recently sold for $4.3 million, setting a record price for an illustration and Parrish art prints rank among the most popular in the world and are distributed in 42 countries. The Image Exchange on America Online reported in January, 1997 that as many as 4,800 people accessed the Maxfield Parrish exhibition on the Internet in a single day.</p><p>Maxfield Parrish (American, 1870-1966), enjoyed a popularity unmatched in the twentieth-century art world. His art prints had an enormous impact on popular American culture, appearing in one out of four households. His images were reproduced everywhere--as illustrations in children's books and in such leading periodicals as <i>Scribner's Magazine</i>, <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, <i>Hearst's Magazine</i>, and <i>Harper's Weekly</i>; as advertisements for everything from bicycles to Jello (tm) and tires to chocolates; as greeting cards; as calendars for, among others, General Electric Edison Mazda Lamps for almost two decades; even as menus and toys. His most successful paintings feature beautiful women posed thoughtfully against dramatic landscapes, and they remain even today among the best-loved works of any American artist.</p><h2>Gates of Paradise (A Blue Bloods Novel)</h2><p>Schuyler Van Alen is running out of time.

But how far will Mimi and Jack go to conceal their real loyalties?<br><br>Meanwhile, former vampire Bliss Llewellyn has joined forces with Lawson, the greatest wolf of the underworld, to free his people from their imprisonment in Hell. As they struggle against impossible odds, an ancient message, woven into the very fabric of time, reveals just how much depends on the success of their mission.<br><br>Lucifer seeks the key to the Gate of Promise, and when Schuyler is taken captive and delivered straight to Hell, she must make an unthinkable choice&#x2014;the same one the archangel Michael was forced to make during the Crisis in Rome. Will Schuyler find the strength to do what he could not? &nbsp;The epic, heartbreaking Blue Bloods series comes to a close with this final novel about staggering courage, unbearable sacrifice, and the immortality of true love.</p><p><strong>Melissa de la Cruz</strong> (www.melissa-delacruz.com) is the author of many best-selling novels, including all the books in the Blue Bloods series: <em>Blue Bloods</em>, <em>Masquerade</em>, <em>Revelations</em>, <em>The Van Alen Legacy, Keys to the Repository, Misguided Angel,</em> <em>Bloody Valentine, </em>and <em>Lost in Time.</em> She lives in Los Angeles, California with her husband and daughter, and is hard at work on her brand new series, The Court of the Last Princess, due out in Winter 2014.The series that started back in 2004 concludes. Lucifer is on the march, Jack and Mimi (vampires AND angels!) seem to be part of his minions, Bliss is joining forces with the werewolves, and heroine Schuyler, as usual, is trying to figure out what s going on. The last title in the seven-book Blue Bloods series (along with two companion volumes) is disjointed in structure and banal in its writing, and in terms of biblical legend, it makes little sense. Fans who have traversed countries and time zones with the gang over the years get the conclusion of a big battle, but it is so unimaginatively written, it might have been a description of a tennis match. Then all is wrapped up with a poorly explained miracle at the end. Though fans will be pleased all the loose ends are neatly tied, whether they ll think the ending offered has been worth waiting for is a question. Those looking for another incarnation of Blue Bloods will not be disappointed. Apparently, more are in the works. Ilene Cooper Booklist Online"<br><br>3Q 5P J S de la Cruz ends her popular Blue Bloods series with this seventh novel that features many of the strengths and weaknesses of its immediate predecessors. Set soon after Lost in Time (Hyperion, 2011/VOYA 2011), the novel finds the characters struggling to stop Lucifer from fighting his way into Heaven. Schuyler and Oliver, after spending time with Kingsley in London, find her father's family in the United States, while Mimi and Jack are sent by Lucifer out of the underworld, each with a terrible task. Bliss, still with Lawson and the others in her wolf pack, has also returned from the underworld to find that a year has passed. Chapters alternate between the three female leads and the historical incarnations of Gabrielle, all of whom, because of the plot-centered narrative, are now virtually indistinguishable and not particularly interesting as characters. In the end, Schuyler has to sacrifice Jack's life in order to vanquish Lucifer; to give up love (not to mention someone else's life) for the greater good is what she must do to undo the sin of her father (who chose love), although it does work out for her in the end. Oddly, the author ignores any of the possible ramifications of a world that no longer includes the Devil in favor of a happy ending. Still, all of the lovers are reunited, Oliver finds his own true love in a slightly icky, almost Breaking Dawn-esque twist, and fans of the series will likely not be disappointed.-Vikki C. Terrile.

Simmons</p><p>CRIME AND PUNISHMENT <br>By Fyodor Dostoevsky <br>Translated By Constance Garnett"Dostoevsky conceived the idea of Crime and Punishment in the summer of 1865, having lost all his money at the casino, unable to pay his bill or afford proper meals. At the time the author owed large sums of money to creditors, and he was trying to help the family of his brother Mikhail, who had died in early 1864. Projected under the title The Drunkards, it was to deal "with the present question of drunkness ... [in] all its ramifications, especially the picture of a family and the bringing up of children in these circumstance, etc., etc." Once Dostoevsky conceived Raskolnikov and his crime, now inspired by the case of Pierre François Lacenaire, this theme became ancillary, centering on the story of the Marmeladov family. <p>Dostoevsky offered his story or novella (at the time Dostoevsky was not thinking of a novel) to the publisher Mikhail Katkov. His monthly journal, The Russian Messenger, was a prestigious publication of its kind, and the outlet for both Ivan Turgenev and Leo Tolstoy, but Dostoevsky, having carried on quite bruising polemics with Katkov in early 1860s, had never published anything in its pages. Dostoevsky turned as a last resort to Katkov, and asked for an advance on a proposed contribution after all other appeals elsewhere failed. In a letter to Katkov written in September 1865, Dostoevsky explained to him that the work was to be about a young man who yields to "certain strange, 'unfinished' ideas, yes floating in the air"; he had thus embarked on his plan to explore the moral and psychological dangers of the "radical" ideology. In letters written in November 1865 an important conceptual change occurred: the "story" has become a "novel", and from here on all references to Crime and Punishment are to a novel. </p><p>Dostoevsky had to race against time, in order to finish on time both The Gambler and Crime and Punishment. Anna Snitkina, a stenographer who would soon become his second wife, was a great help for Dostoevsky during this difficult task. The first part of Crime and Punishment appeared in the January 1866 issue of The Russian Messenger, and the last one was published in December 1866." - Wikipedia</p></p><h2>The Intellectual Life of the British Working Classes</h2><p>Which books did the British working classes read--and how did they read them? How did they respond to canonical authors, penny dreadfuls, classical music, school stories, Shakespeare, Marx, Hollywood movies, imperialist propaganda, the Bible, the BBC, the Bloomsbury Group? What was the quality of their classroom education? How did they educate themselves? What was their level of cultural literacy: how much did they know about politics, science, history, philosophy, poetry, and sexuality? Who were the proletarian intellectuals, and why did they pursue the life of the mind? These intriguing questions, which until recently historians considered unanswerable, are addressed in this book. Using innovative research techniques and a vast range of unexpected sources, The Intellectual Life of the British Working Classes tracks the rise and decline of the British autodidact from the pre-industrial era to the twentieth century. It offers a new method for cultural historians--an &#34;audience history&#34; that recovers the responses of readers, students, theatergoers, filmgoers, and radio listeners. Jonathan Rose provides an intellectual history of people who were not expected to think for themselves, told from their perspective. He draws on workers&#39; memoirs, oral history, social surveys, opinion polls, school records, library registers, and newspapers. Through its novel and challenging approach to literary history, the book gains access to politics, ideology, popular culture, and social relationships across two centuries of British working-class experience.</p><p>Jonathan Rose is the founder and past president of the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing (SHARP) and coeditor of the journal Book History.

His English publisher had excised many of the Scottish words and phrases he had used to evoke the suspense of the novel. From simple misreadings to deliberate revisions, subsequent printed editions represented major departures from Stevenson&#39;s handwritten text. Now Barry Menikoff has restored the author&#39;s language and punctuation, as well as the authentic Scots quality of his diction. In doing so, he has given readers a clearer picture of both Stevenson&#39;s skill as a storyteller and the novel&#39;s social and political context.For the better part of a century &#34;Kidnapped&#34; has occupied an ambiguous position in literary and cultural studies. Its initial appearance in a weekly magazine called &#34;Young Folks Paper,&#34; along with Stevenson&#39;s disingenuous comment that the novel had a diverting rather than a serious aim, have in effect trapped the book in the never-neverland of children&#39;s literature. Yet it is universally acknowledges as a classic of world literature and the novelist always considered it his finest achievement -- taken together with its sequel, &#34;David Balfour,&#34; the best he was capable of in fiction. Now, for the first readers can plainly see why Stevenson placed his story of David Balfour on so high a pedestal. Drawing on the unique autograph manuscript in California&#39;s Huntington Library, Professor Barry Menikoff faithfully reproduces the text as Stevenson originally wrote it, restoring the punctuation (of which the novelist was a master) and recovering the distinctive and often singular language that had been altered or deleted. The effect is to deepen and illuminate the Scottish texture of the novel. For a book so embedded in Scottish history as &#34;Kidnapped,&#34; so revelatory of its fierce loyalties and violent enmities, the discovery that Stevenson was even more nationalistic than we had known comes at an opportune moment, with the opening of the new Scottish parliament. This handsome new edition of a novel whose avowed purpose was the recovery of an important part of Scots history reproduces for the first time the original drawings that accompanied the text during its serialization in &#34;Young Folks.&#34; Professor Menikoff&#39;s substantial introduction situates the book in its cultural context, and enables us to see why Stevenson&#39;s contemporaries were both entranced and awed by his achievement. And in his extensive notes to the novel he reveals Stevenson&#39;s enormous prestige as an authority on language, both English and Scots, for &#34;Kidnapped&#34; was widely drawn upon as a reference by lexicographers for the &#34;Oxford English Dictionary&#34; and the &#34;Scottish National Dictionary.&#34; Finally, for a tale that charts the &#34;wanderings&#34; of David Balfour over the land and seas of Scotland, this edition is the first to provide a gazetteer of place-names encountered during the course of those travels.</p><h2>Assegai</h2><p><p>It is 1913 and ex-soldier turned professional big game hunter, Leon Courtney, is in British East Africa guiding rich and powerful men from America and Europe on safaris in the Masai tribe territories.

The Wasp kinden have been slowly conquering the land for three generations, and the people of the Lowlands are finally waking to the danger that confronts them. As Wasps threaten Collegium, a city of innovators and a rallying point for Lowland resistance, the diverse protagonists struggle to salvage what they can, unleashing forces beyond their control. The story will be recognizable to anyone familiar with modern fantasy (or even the Persian invasion of Greece), but Tchaikovsky's setting is innovative, the characters are engaging, and the battles are epic.

What happened to those children is the fascinating subject of Robert Gottlieb's <i>Great Expectations</i>. With sympathy and understanding he narrates the highly various and surprising stories of each of Dickens's sons and daughters, from Kate, who became a successful artist, to Frank, who died in Moline, Illinois, after serving a grim stretch in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</p><p>Each of these lives is fascinating on its own.

Gottlieb profiles each of the 10 Dickens children&#x2014;seven sons and three daughters, one who died in infancy&#x2014;and includes a chapter on the scandalous possible existence of an 11th child, a son born to Ellen Ternan, Dickens's probable mistress. The book is divided into two separate, chronological sections delineated by Dickens's death in 1870, a structural choice that re-enacts the way in which Dickens held ultimate control over the life narratives of his children, and demonstrates just how large his shadow loomed as both an excellence-demanding father and a disappointment-doling ghost. Life was often bleak for the siblings, who were subject to Dickens's often brutal scrutiny and the life-altering decisions that followed. Gottlieb studs these portraits with artifacts ripe for happy discovery, including excerpts from personal letters and rare photographs. The results are fascinating but often tragic, with each Dickens baby born with more perceived brilliance than the last, only to grow up and reveal a fatal ordinariness to their father. This smart and accessible biography is written in a clever, conversational tone that radiates coziness during even the coldest moments, keeping the pages swiftly turning.

Philosopher Alex Rosenberg maintains that science is the only thing that can really answer them&#x2015;all of them. His bracing and ultimately upbeat book takes physics seriously as the complete description of reality and accepts all its consequences. He shows how physics makes Darwinian natural selection the only way life can emerge, and how that deprives nature of purpose, and human action of meaning, while it exposes conscious illusions such as free will and the self. The science that makes us nonbelievers provides the insight into the real difference between right and wrong, the nature of the mind, even the direction of human history. <em>The Atheist's Guide to Reality</em> draws powerful implications for the ethical and political issues that roil contemporary life. The result is nice nihilism, a surprisingly sanguine perspective atheists can happily embrace.</p><p>Alex Rosenberg is the R.

Go ahead, take a bite. <i>--Lauren Nemroff</i> <strong>A Q&amp;A with Alan Bradley</strong><br><br> <b>Question:</b> With the publication of <i>The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie</i>, you&#x2019;ve become a 70-year-old-first time novelist. Have you always had a passion for writing, or is it more of a recent development? <br> <p><b>Alan Bradley:</b> Well, the Roman author Seneca once said something like this: &#x201c;Hang on to your youthful enthusiasms--you&#x2019;ll be able to use them better when you&#x2019;re older.&#x201d; So to put it briefly, I&#x2019;m taking his advice.</p> <p>I actually spent most of my life working on the technical side of television production, but would like to think that I&#x2019;ve always been a writer. I started writing a novel at age five, and have written articles for various publications all my life. It wasn&#x2019;t until my early retirement, though, that I started writing books. I published my memoir, <i>The Shoebox Bible</i>, in 2004, and then started working on a mystery about a reporter in England. It was during the writing of this story that I stumbled across Flavia de Luce, the main character in <i>Sweetness</i>.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Flavia certainly is an interesting character. How did you come up with such a forceful, precocious and entertaining personality?</p> <p><b>AB:</b> Flavia walked onto the page of another book I was writing, and simply hijacked the story. I was actually well into this other book--about three or four chapters--and as I introduced a main character, a detective, there was a point where he was required to go to a country house and interview this colonel.</p> <p>I got him up to the driveway and there was this girl sitting on a camp stool doing something with a notebook and a pencil and he stopped and asked her what she was doing and she said &#x201c;writing down license number plates&#x201c; and he said &#x201c;well there can't be many in such a place&#x201c; and she said, &#x201c;well I have yours, don&#x2019;t I? &#x201c; I came to a stop. I had no idea who this girl was and where she came from.</p> <p>She just materialized. I can't take any credit for Flavia at all. I&#x2019;ve never had a character who came that much to life. I&#x2019;ve had characters that tend to tell you what to do, but Flavia grabbed the controls on page one. She sprung full-blown with all of her attributes--her passion for poison, her father and his history--all in one package. It surprised me.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> There aren&#x2019;t many adult books that feature child narrators. Why did you want Flavia to be the voice of this novel?</p> <p><b>AB:</b> People probably wonder, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s a 70-year-old-man doing writing about an 11-year-old-girl in 1950s England? &#x201c; And it&#x2019;s a fair question. To me, Flavia embodies that kind of hotly burning flame of our young years: that time of our lives when we&#x2019;re just starting out, when anything--absolutely anything!--is within our capabilities. </p> <p>I think the reason that she manifested herself as a young girl is that I realized that it would really be a lot of fun to have somebody who was virtually invisible in a village. And of course, we don&#x2019;t listen to what children say--they&#x2019;re always asking questions, and nobody pays the slightest attention or thinks for a minute that they&#x2019;re going to do anything with the information that they let slip. I wanted Flavia to take great advantage of that. I was also intrigued by the possibilities of dealing with an unreliable narrator; one whose motives were not always on the up-and-up.</p> <p>She is an amalgam of burning enthusiasm, curiosity, energy, youthful idealism, and frightening fearlessness. She&#x2019;s also a very real menace to anyone who thwarts her, but fortunately, they don&#x2019;t generally realize it. </p> <p><b>Q:</b> Like Flavia, you were also 11 years old in 1950. Is there anything autobiographical about her character?</p> <p><b>AB:</b> Somebody pointed out the fact that both Flavia and I lacked a parent. But I wasn&#x2019;t aware of this connection during the writing of the book. It simply didn&#x2019;t cross my mind. It is true that I grew up in a home with only one parent, and I was allowed to run pretty well free, to do the kinds of things I wanted. And I did have extremely intense interests then--things that you get focused on. When you&#x2019;re that age, you sometimes have a great enthusiasm that is very deep and very narrow, and that is something that has always intrigued me--that world of the 11-year-old that is so quickly lost.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Your story evokes such a vivid setting. Had you spent much time in the British countryside before writing this book?</p> <p><b>AB:</b> My first trip to England didn&#x2019;t come until I went to London to receive the 2007 Debut Dagger Award, so I had never even stepped foot in the country at the time of writing <i>Sweetness</i>. But I have always loved England. My mother was born there. And I&#x2018;ve always felt I grew up in a very English household. I had always wanted to go and had dreamed for many years of doing so. </p> <p>When I finally made it there, the England that I was seeing with my eyes was quite unlike the England I had imagined, and yet it was the same. I realized that the differences were precisely those differences between real life, and the simulation of real life, that we create in our detective novels. So this was an opportunity to create on the page this England that had been in my head my whole life.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> You have five more books lined up in this series, all coming from Delacorte Press. Will Flavia age as the series goes on?</p> <p><b>AB:</b> A bit, not very much. I think she&#x2019;s going to remain in the same age bracket. I don&#x2019;t really like the idea of Flavia as an older teenager. At her current age, she is such a concoction of contradictions. It's one of the things that I very much love about her. She's eleven but she has the wisdom of an adult. She knows everything about chemistry but nothing about family relationships. I don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;d be the same person if she were a few years older. She certainly wouldn&#x2019;t have access to the drawing rooms of the village.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Do you have a sense of what the next books in the series will be about?</p> <p><b>AB:</b> The second book, <i>The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag</i>, is finished, and I&#x2019;m working on the third book. I have a general idea of what&#x2019;s happening in each one of the books, because I wanted to focus on some bygone aspect of British life that was still there in the '50s but has now vanished. So we have postage stamps in the first one... The second book is about the travelling puppet shows on the village green. And one of them is about filmmaking--it sort of harks back to the days of the classic Ealing comedies with Alec Guinness and so forth.</p> <b>Q:</b> Not every author garners such immediate success with a first novel. After only completing 15 pages of <i>Sweetness</i>, you won the Dagger award and within 8 days had secured book deals in 3 countries. You&#x2019;ve since secured 19 countries. Enthusiasm continues to grow from every angle. How does it feel?<p></p> <p><b>AB:</b> It's like being in the glow of a fire. You hope you won't get burned. I&#x2019;m not sure how much I&#x2019;ve realized it yet. I guess I can say I&#x2018;m &#x201c;almost overwhelmed&#x201d;--I&#x2019;m not quite overwhelmed, but I&#x2019;m getting there. Every day has something new happening, and communications pouring in from people all over. The book has been receiving wonderful reviews and touching people. But Flavia has been touching something in people that generates a response from the heart, and the most often mentioned word in the reviews is love--how much people love Flavia and have taken her in as if she&#x2019;s a long-lost member of their family, which is certainly very, very gratifying.</p> <p>(Photo � Jeff Bassett)</p>Alan Bradley</p><h2>Murder by the Book (The Rex Stout Library)</h2><p>When everyone who has read Leonard Dykes&#39;s unpublished manuscript--including the author himself--is found dead, Nero Wolfe, along with his sidekick, decides to set a trap. Reissue.</p><p>DeceasedNero Wolfe and his sidekick, Archie, connect the dots between three seemingly unconnected murders, as always a step ahead of the chronically baffled and frustrated Inspector Cramer. Linking the murders of a law clerk, an editor, and a typist is a missing book manuscript with potentially damaging information about a prominent law firm. Narrator Michael Prichard has Wolfe, Archie, and Cramer down pat, and does justice to the supporting cast of quirky women and men. Prichard shifts smoothly from one to another and keeps the story moving at a pace that never lags while allowing listeners time to absorb the intricacies of plot. This absorbing 1940s mystery will entertain Stout fans and newcomers alike.

She currently lives in Bath. <i>A Royal Experiment</i> is her first book.<p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p><i>The Strangest Family</i></p> <p>GEORGE III&#x2019;S FIRST SPEECH FROM the throne was a resounding declaration of his particular fitness to take up the task before him. &#x2018;Born and educated in this country,&#x2019; he pronounced, &#x2018;I glory in the name of Britain.&#x2019;1 It was not a statement any of his immediate predecessors could have made, which was of course precisely why he said it. From the very earliest days of his reign, he sought to mark himself out from his Hanoverian forebears. Neither George I nor George II had been born in Britain, and neither ever thought of the country as home. Their true <i>Heimat</i> was Hanover, a princely state in northern Germany in whose flat farmlands the dynasty had its ancestral roots. They both thought of themselves first and foremost as electors of Hanover; their kingship of England, Scotland and Ireland came very much second in their hearts.</p> <p>When George III became monarch, the family had been somewhat reluctantly seated on the throne for only forty-six years. The crown of Great Britain had not been a prize they had expected to inherit, but they had done so with the death of Queen Anne in 1714. Anne was the daughter of James II, the last Stuart king, who was forced off his throne in 1688 when his Catholicism became unacceptable to the Protestant English. In the Glorious Revolution that followed, the Dutch prince William of Orange, nephew and son-in-law of the deposed James, was invited to become king, with the stipulation that henceforth, only a Protestant could become sovereign, a qualification still in force today. Anne, who succeeded the childless William, was known with cruel irony as &#x2018;the teeming Princess of Denmark&#x2019;. Her pregnancies were many, but, despite an appalling catalogue of gynaecological endurance, she had no living children to show for it; she lost five babies in infancy and suffered thirteen miscarriages. When her only surviving child, the eleven-year-old Duke of Gloucester, died in 1700, it was clear that an heir must be looked for elsewhere.</p> <p>The defenders of the Glorious Revolution did not find it easy to identify a suitably qualified candidate. Catholicism ruled out James II&#x2019;s exiled son, who had otherwise by far the strongest claim, as well as fifty-six other religiously unacceptable potential heirs. Eventually, it was decided to offer the crown to Electress Sophia of Hanover. A daughter of Charles I&#x2019;s sister Elizabeth, in purely dynastic terms her claim was weaker than those of many more directly related contenders, but her impeccable Protestant credentials won the day, and it was her name and that of her descendants which was enshrined in the Act of Settlement of 1701 as heirs to the crown if Queen Anne should die without a child. When Anne&#x2019;s health, exhausted by a lifetime of fruitless childbearing, fatally gave out in 1714, the electress was already dead, so the succession passed to her eldest son, George Louis. He was crowned in London later that year as George I.</p> <p>It was not an entirely popular choice. The Jacobites &#x2013; supporters of the old Stuart monarchy &#x2013; rioted in at least twenty English towns. It was worse in Scotland, still smarting with outraged national grievance at the Act of Union, which linked the nations together in 1707, and whose simmering discontents erupted into the uprisings of 1715 and 1745. Although on those occasions it looked as if Hanoverians might be forced back to the electorate that was always their first love, they hung on, somewhat despite themselves, and it was their dynasty that ruled Britain until the death of George III&#x2019;s son, William IV, in 1837.</p> <p>As a child, the diarist Horace Walpole, who wrote so voluminously about George I&#x2019;s successors, had a brief encounter with the first of the Hanoverians. His father, Sir Robert Walpole, was George&#x2019;s first minister, and as such was able to gratify for his son &#x2018;the first vehement inclination that I ever expressed&nbsp;&#x2026; to see the king&#x2019;. He was taken in the evening to St James&#x2019;s Palace and, after supper, informally introduced to the monarch. The ten-year-old Horace &#x2018;knelt down and kissed his hand, he said a few words to me, and my conductress led me back to my mother&#x2019;. Writing nearly seventy years later, Walpole recalled that &#x2018;the person of the king is as perfect in my memory, as if I saw him but yesterday. It was that of an elderly man, rather pale and exactly like his pictures and coins; tall; of an aspect rather good than august; and with a dark tie wig, a plain coat, waistcoat and breeches of a snuff-coloured cloth, with stockings of the same colour, and a blue riband all over.&#x2019; He had, he thought in retrospect, been remarkably indulged, for the king &#x2018;took me up in his arms, kissed me and chatted some time&#x2019;.2</p> <p>Walpole, who in later life liked to think of himself as almost a republican, and who observed that he had &#x2018;never since felt any enthusiasm for royal persons&#x2019;, was clearly captivated. But there was another side to the king who seemed so kind and genial to the starstruck small boy. For it was George I who must bear much of the responsibility for nurturing the tradition of Hanoverian family hatred that was to bequeath such a miserable inheritance to future generations.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>George I&#x2019;s own experience of family life was hardly a happy one. His father, Ernst August, was a man of calculating ambition, dominated by the all-pervasive desire to see his dukedom of Hanover elevated to the far greater status of an electorate. His many children were raised in an atmosphere of military discipline, expected to display absolute obedience to his will and utter devotion to the grand project of dynastic consolidation. He seldom saw any of them alone or in informal circumstances; unsurprisingly, they were said to be &#x2018;solemn and restrained&#x2019; in his presence.3 Ernst&#x2019;s wife Sophia, whose antecedents were ultimately to bring the crown of Great Britain into the family&#x2019;s possession, was a far more relaxed and sympathetic character than her unbending husband &#x2013; Walpole described her as &#x2018;a woman of parts and great vivacity&#x2019; &#x2013; but she too submitted without question to her husband&#x2019;s severe dictatorship.4 Any resistance on her part had been undone by love. She had expected very little from her arranged marriage, and when, against all her expectations, Ernst proved a passionate and enthusiastic lover, Sophia could not believe her luck. From her wedding night onwards, for the rest of her life, she was completely in thrall to her husband&#x2019;s judgement, never venturing to set her own considerable intellect against any of his schemes. Ernst&#x2019;s numerous affairs with other women caused her much pain &#x2013; in middle age, she wrote sadly that she could not believe she had ever been so foolish as to imagine he would remain faithful to her for ever &#x2013; yet she fought hard to preserve her primacy in his eyes. She was much tried by his long relationship with the malicious Countess von Platen, who subjected her over many years to a litany of carefully calculated public insults; but Sophia&#x2019;s commitment to the errant Ernst August never wavered. She once declared that she would &#x2018;gladly have followed him to the Antipodes&#x2019;.5</p> <p>Sophia&#x2019;s dogged devotion won her no part at all in her husband&#x2019;s political strategising. He acknowledged the sharpness of her mind but denied her any active role in his schemes. She was &#x2018;without influence&#x2019; in family affairs and allowed no say in the making of even the most significant decisions. When Ernst decided to disinherit his many younger sons in order to consolidate all the family possessions in the hands of George, the eldest, Sophia could do nothing to protect their interests. Angry and betrayed, three of the brothers left Ernst&#x2019;s court and signed on as soldiers in the Imperial service. Within a few years, all had died in battle, to the despairing grief of their mother. She was equally powerless when Ernst began to make marriage plans for the favoured George. Ernst had long before decided that his eldest son would marry his cousin, Sophia Dorothea of Celle, thus uniting two branches of the family dukedoms into a single greater state.</p> <p>For all its desirability as a political alliance, it was obvious to anyone who knew them that George and Sophia Dorothea were hardly well matched. Sophia Dorothea, who was only eleven when the marriage was first proposed, had been brought up from her earliest days in a relaxed atmosphere of indulgence and luxury. Her father, a very different man from his single-minded brother Ernst, had married for love a woman considered beneath him in the complicated gradations of princely hierarchy, and had sacrificed the opportunity for further aggrandisement as a result. Sophia Dorothea, the only child of this love match, grew up into a beautiful woman &#x2013; sophisticated, conscious of her attractiveness, and considered very French in her tastes. She loved to be amused and entertained, and was said to be obsessed by fashion. Lively and good-looking, she had no shortage of suitors. Her prospective mother-in-law regarded her balefully; she was sure she would not find a soulmate in her reserved and cautious eldest son.</p> <p>Sophia, who described herself as &#x2018;a nearly stupidly fond mother&#x2019;, was devoted to the silent and watchful George.6 She admired her son&#x2019;s deep sense of responsibility and his formidable devotion to duty. Others found him harder to appreciate. His cousin, the Duchess of Orl�ans, thought him &#x2018;ordinarily neither cheerful nor friendly, dry and crabbed&#x2019;. She complained that &#x2018;his words have to be squeezed out of him&#x2019;, that he was suspicious, proud, parsimonious and had &#x2018;no natural good-heartedness&#x2019;.7 Sophia maintained that those who thought her son sullen simply did not understand him; they did not see that, beneath his undemonstrative surface, he took things much to heart, and was far more sensitive than he was prepared to show. But she knew him well enough to suspect that he was not the best partner for the outgoing Sophia Dorothea, who loved playful conversation, sought out cheerful company and had a taste for extravagant entertainments. The prospective bride&#x2019;s mother had similar misgivings; but neither could persuade their respective husbands to take their concerns seriously.</p> <p>George himself had little to say on the subject. It was widely supposed that he would have been happy to be left alone with his mistress, a sister of the Countess von Platen, who had &#x2013; as it were &#x2013; continued the family business, becoming the son&#x2019;s lover, as her sister was the father&#x2019;s. However, obedience, not self-fulfilment, came first in the young George&#x2019;s mind. He had seen Sophia Dorothea, and had apparently been impressed by her good looks; but there is little doubt that he would have taken her anyway, regardless of any personal qualities, once his father had wished it. His mother once remarked that &#x2018;George would marry a cripple if he could serve the House of Brunswick&#x2019;.8 In 1682, the ill-matched couple did the bidding of their fathers, and were married. Sophia Dorothea was sixteen, her groom five years older.</p> <p>At first they seem to have made the best of things, and in 1683 Sophia Dorothea gave birth to a son, George August. Such speedy provision of a healthy male heir raised her immeasurably in Ernst&#x2019;s eyes, and for a few years Sophia Dorothea&#x2019;s life was probably not unpleasant. Under the eye of her satisfied father-in-law, she enjoyed court life at the elaborate palace of Herrenhausen, relishing the parties, masques and concerts Ernst August laid on there to magnify his grandeur. She saw very little of her husband. George&#x2019;s great passion was the army, which took him away on active service for long periods. When Ernst August took his entire court to Italy for a year, Sophia Dorothea went on the extended holiday without her husband. Reunited with George on her return, she conceived a daughter who was named after her. But thrown back into each other&#x2019;s company, the strategy of polite coexistence the couple had maintained with some success began to fall apart. Bored and frustrated, Sophia Dorothea began to behave badly; she picked quarrels, caused scenes and was outspokenly impatient of the etiquette that ruled court life, apparently driven both to dominate and to despise the circumstances in which she lived. One observer called her &#x2018;<i>une beaut� tyrannique</i>&#x2019;.9</p> <p>Her unhappiness was given an edge of anger when she discovered that her taciturn husband had taken another mistress, and one whom he seemed genuinely to love. Melusine von Schulenberg had none of Sophia Dorothea&#x2019;s physical attractions &#x2013; she was tall and thin, nicknamed &#x2018;the scarecrow&#x2019; by George&#x2019;s mother &#x2013; but she was calm, malleable and good-natured, in contrast to Sophia Dorothea&#x2019;s more febrile character. She sought to manage George&#x2019;s moods, and make his life easier, whilst his wife seemed only to cause him difficulties. Sophia Dorothea was bitterly humiliated by her husband&#x2019;s public preference for a woman far less beautiful and of lower social status than herself, and she refused to adopt the wronged wife&#x2019;s traditional stance of dignified resignation. She scolded her resentful husband, made scenes at court, and complained to her father-in-law. In doing so, not only did she earn the lasting resentment of George&#x2019;s mother (who could not see why she should not submit quietly to marital infidelity, as she had done), but also made enemies of the powerful Platen women, who disliked Sophia Dorothea&#x2019;s wilder accusations against mistresses and their wiles. Unhappy, rejected and isolated amongst people who were embarrassed and annoyed by her indiscreet outbursts, Sophia Dorothea was in a very vulnerable state. It is perhaps not surprising that she was so quickly persuaded to do the very worst and dangerous thing she could have done in such circumstances: fall in love with another man.</p> <p>It was at this inauspicious moment that &#x2018;the famous and beautiful&#x2019; Count Philip von K�nigsmark arrived at the Hanoverian court. He was a Swedish aristocrat, rich, handsome, clever, witty and assured, an archetypal sophisticated bad boy who had gambled, fought and drunk his way across Europe before enlisting as an officer in the Hanoverian service. He was everything Sophia Dorothea&#x2019;s dour husband was not, and was obviously attracted to her. They enjoyed each other&#x2019;s company, and when he left to join the army, he began to write to her. Soon the letters they exchanged were those of lovers. At first, they were careful &#x2013; &#x2018;If I were not writing to a person for whom my respect is as great as my love,&#x2019; wrote K�nigsmark, &#x2018;I should find better terms to express my passion&#x2019; &#x2013; but as their relationship grew more intense, they became less discreet.10</p> <p>When K�nigsmark returned, they snatched meetings in corridors, and exchanged glances in ballrooms. People noticed. They became the object of gossip, spread avidly by the Platens. Eventually, even Sophia Dorothea&#x2019;s mother heard the talk, and begged her daughter to break off the affair. She refused, and for over two years sustained her love for the count through occasional meetings and lengthy correspondence, in which she did not hesitate to declare the strength of her feelings, even confessing she would like to abandon her empty, unsatisfactory life. &#x2018;I thought a thousand times of following you,&#x2019; she wrote, &#x2018;what would I not give to be able to do it, and always be with you. But I should be too happy and there is no such bliss in this world.&#x2019;11</p> <p>Yet for all her declaration of its impossibility, the idea of starting a new life with K�nigsmark became an obsession for her. By 1694, both her parents were aware that she wanted to end her twelve-year marriage. Rumours of an impending elopement transfixed the court. K�nigsmark&#x2019;s recent appointment as commander of a Saxon regiment seemed to offer the couple both the resources and the opportunity...</p></p><h2>No Future Without Forgiveness</h2><p>This is the Archbishop&#39;s personal account of his experience as head of South Africa&#39;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission broadening the debate on the merits of reconciliation after conflict with observations, based on visits to, and experience of Northern Ireland, the Middle East, Dachau and Rwanda.</p><p>Archbishop Desmond Tutu stands alongside Nelson Mandela as one of the most iconic figures of the struggle to end apartheid in South Africa. As archbishop of Cape Town throughout the 1980s, Tutu came to symbolize dignified, rational opposition to the iniquities of the apartheid regime, a faithful irreverence for unjust authority that led to his being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984. In 1995 he took up his greatest challenge, as chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the remarkable yet harrowing attempt by South Africans to come to terms with the gross violations of human rights committed throughout the apartheid era by offering amnesty and forgiveness rather than punishment and dismissal. <p> <i>No Future Without Forgiveness</i> is Tutu's remarkable personal memoir of his time as chair of the commission. It records his insistence of the need to discover a "third way" in the healing of the national psyche and his powerful belief that "we can indeed transcend the conflicts of the past, we can hold hands as we realize our common humanity." Tutu's characteristic humor, resilience, and compassion are evoked in a way that demonstrates how essential they have been to his unique political style--and his ability to get results where all others failed. He recalls the darkest days of apartheid's "vicious awfulness" when, preaching about God's authority, he was "frequently tempted to whisper in God's ear, 'For goodness sake, why don't You make it more obvious that <i>You are</i> in charge?"'</p><p> <i>No Future Without Forgiveness</i> could be profitably read alongside Antjie Krog's equally compelling <i>Country of My Skull</i>, as it considers the emotional toll that such a process of national soul-searching has had upon its participants. As Tutu himself points out, "It is a costly business to try to heal a wounded and traumatized people, and those engaging in that crucial task will perhaps bear the brunt themselves ... we were, in Henri Nouwen's celebrated phrase, 'wounded healers.'" <i>--Rachel Holmes, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>uth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa has put the spotlight on all of us...In its hearings Desmond Tutu has conveyed our common pain and sorrow, our hope and confidence in the future." <br>--Nelson Mandela<br><br>The establishment of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission was a pioneering international event. Never had any country sought to move forward from despotism to democracy both by exposing the atrocities committed in the past and achieving reconciliation with its former oppressors. At the center of this unprecedented attempt at healing a nation has been Archbishop Desmond Tutu, whom President Nelson Mandela named as Chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. With the final report of the Commission just published, Archbishop Tutu offers his reflections on the profound wisdom he has gained by helping usher South Africa through this painful experience.<br><br>In <b>No Future Without Forgiveness</b>, Tutu argues that true reconciliation c</p><h2>Hydrogen: The Essential Element</h2><p><p> Seduced by simplicity, physicists find themselves endlessly fascinated by hydrogen, the simplest of atoms. Hydrogen has shocked, it has surprised, it has embarrassed, it has humbled--and again and again it has guided physicists to the edge of new vistas where the promise of basic understanding and momentous insights beckoned. The allure of hydrogen, crucial to life and critical to scientific discovery, is at the center of this book, which tells a story that begins with the big bang and continues to unfold today. </p><p> In this biography of hydrogen, John Rigden shows how this singular atom, the most abundant in the universe, has helped unify our understanding of the material world from the smallest scale, the elementary particles, to the largest, the universe itself. It is a tale of startling discoveries and dazzling practical benefits spanning more than one hundred years--from the first attempt to identify the basic building block of atoms in the mid-nineteenth century to the discovery of the Bose-Einstein condensate only a few years ago. With Rigden as an expert and engaging guide, we see how hydrogen captured the imagination of many great scientists--such as Heisenberg, Pauli, Schr�dinger, Dirac, and Rabi--and how their theories and experiments with this simple atom led to such complex technical innovations as magnetic resonance imaging, the maser clock, and global positioning systems. Along the way, we witness the transformation of science from an endeavor of inspired individuals to a monumental enterprise often requiring the cooperation of hundreds of scientists around the world. </p><p> Still, any biography of hydrogen has to end with a question: What new surprises await us? </p></p><p><b>John Rigden</b> is Adjunct Professor of Physics, Washington University in St. Louis.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/RIGHYD_X.pdf</p><h2>Living With ADD: A Workbook for Adults With Attention Deficit Disorder</h2><p>An estimated 3 to 10 million adults in the US struggle with the symptoms of attention-deficit disorder (ADD.)

Aytch</i> has reigned as one of the most memorable and honest depictions of the American Civil War since its original publication in 1882. Sam R. Watkins's first-hand account of life as a Confederate soldier eloquently captured the realities of war, the humor and pathos of soldiering, and the tragic, historic events in which he participated. Although there have been dozens of versions of <i>Co. Aytch</i> published, this is the first with new material and revisions by Sam Watkins himself. Intending to republish after his first edition sold out, Watkins edited and revised <i>Co. Aytch</i> adding a new perspective that only came with time. He died before accomplishing his goal. Now more than one hundred years later, Watkins's great granddaughter, Ruth Hill Fulton McAllister is fulfilling Watkins s dream. Using his yellowed, aged, and pencil-marked copy handed down through different family members, McAllister has crafted a masterpiece that combines the ageless text with Sam Watkins's intended revisions. <p> This new edition incorporates actual images of Watkins's handwritten additions, all his desired editorial changes, and more than forty images. Desiring to be true to both her ancestor's wishes and the sanctity of his classic memoir, McAllister skillfully included Watkins's additions and artfully indicated what he would have omitted, leaving the original text intact. The result is a rich, expanded, director's cut version of <i>Co. Aytch,</i> sure to fascinate historians, Civil War enthusiasts, and new readers alike.</p></p><p>"The only thing better than Sam Watkins is more Sam Watkins. This is a marvelous expansion of the best memoir of a fighting soldier south of the Mason-Dixon line we have." Ken Burns, Filmmaker "Sam Watkins&#x2019;s memoir &#x201c;Co. Aytch&#x201d; has long been a classic of Civil War literature, and this new edition only makes it more so. His revisions and additions enhance and refine his story. Some of them are pointed, others hilarious, but they all add depth to one of the must-read soldier narratives of that conflict." William C. Davis, Director of the Virginia Center for Civil War Studies at Virginia Tech "Of all memoirs by a Civil War footsoldier, Sam Watkins&#x2019;s &#x201c;Co. Aytch&#x201d; is probably the best known. His keen intelligence, mature understanding, sound historical perspective, and engaging style strikingly convey the timeless, horrendous hell &#x2018;of the thing called glorious war.&#x2019; Fighting in all of his regiment&#x2019;s major battles from Shiloh to Nashville, no veteran knew war more intimately than Watkins. Now this new edition, featuring the Tennessean&#x2019;s handwritten revisions, particularly underscoring his disgust with Confederate conscription, incompetent generals, the military caste system, and more, will surely garner a receptive audience among all who recognize and respect honest realism." James Lee McDonough,Professor Emeritus of History, Auburn University Author of &#x201c;Nashville: The Western Confederacy&#x2019;s Final Gamble,&#x201d; and other Civil War books "Reading &#x2018;&#x201c;Co. Aytch&#x201d;--Ten Years Later&#x2019; compared to the original we've always known is like the difference between seeing a baseball game through a knothole in the outfield fence and a seat behind home plate. It's the same event, but the expanded view makes it a whole 'nother experience. With this new edition, &#x201c;Co. Aytch&#x201d; will reach a new plateau&#x2014;to become the first book to achieve &#x2018;classic&#x2019; stature twice." Joe Avalon, Editor, Civil War Interactive "Incorporating revisions and notes that he prepared for a second edition that never went to press, this new edition of Sam R. Watkins&#x2019;s &#x201c;Co. Aytch&#x201d; is fascinating. It provides a rare opportunity to see an author&#x2019;s revisions in his own handwriting as well as in easy to read type. It is timely as well with the Civil War Sesquicentennial less than four years away. All should be grateful to the publisher and to Sam&#x2019;s great granddaughter Ruth Hill Fulton McAllister who acquired the marked up first edition from another family member in 1999 and now shares it." Walter T. Durham, Tennessee State Historian "Sam Watkins&#x2019;s chronicle of soldiering in the Confederate army is one of the most powerful accounts yet of the violence, sacrifice, and heroism of the Civil War. This valuable new book, including for the first time Watkins&#x2019;s own handwritten revisions of the original edition, is most welcome and timely." Carroll Van West, Director, Tennessee Civil War National Heritage Area; Director, MTSU Center for Historic Preservation "Sam's tender memories of those far from halcyon days of his youth, come alive more clearly than they ever have before. His bird's eye view of a soldier's life and his sense of fairness and goodness in a time when little of either were to be found, coupled with his almost 'Forrest Gumpian' ability to be in the right place at the right time has drawn historians, scholars and boy soldiers, like myself, to his tales for over century. All of us, alike, have something to celebrate in the publication of this edition of &#x201c;Co. Aytch&#x201d; with Sam's own revisions." Robert Hicks, author of &#x201c;The Widow Of The South&#x201d; "Among the best known and most quoted Civil War memoirs by both historians and buffs is that authored by the irrepressible Confederate soldier Sam Watkins. Thanks to the sleuthing of Watkins&#x2019; great granddaughter, Ruth Hill Fulton McAllister, abetted by Providence House Publishers, readers now have the opportunity to savor the annotations made by Sam Watkins to his seminal 1882 publication. These annotations were added by Watkins to the new edition, which he planned to publish, but hard-times and his death precluded this endeavor. The results presented in a handsome format will enrich and provide the reader with new insights into Watkins&#x2019; military service, and will appeal to the broad constituency that have been long interested in Sam&#x2019;s trials, tribulations, and opinions." Edwin C. Bearss, Historian Emeritus, National Park ServiceSamuel R. Watkins was born on June 26, 1839 near Columbia, Tennessee. He enlisted into the First Tennessee Infantry, Company H (the Maury Grays) at the beginning of the Civil War. Upon surrender, Watkins was one out of only seven men remaining from the 120 originally enlisted in his regiment. Sam was encouraged by friends and family to write down his memories. They were first published as a newspaper series and then finally published in book form in 1882. It was almost immediately hailed as an important Civil War work. After the war, Sam married his sweetheart Jennie, and they raised eight children. Sam Watkins died on July 20, 1901, at the age of sixty-two. <p> Ruth Hill Fulton McAllister is Sam Watkins's great granddaughter. She earned a bachelor's degree in history from Vanderbilt University. After earning her degree, Ruth Hill taught high-school history and government in LaFayette, Georgia, before serving as a staff member for Campus Crusade for Christ in Atlanta. She is currently assistant producer of the syndicated call-in radio show <i>Dawson McAllister Live.</i> Ruth Hill and her husband, Dawson, live in Columbia, Tennessee, and have two sons.

Bending sharply, she teetered, braced herself with one hand to the ground, and searched with the other. <br><br>Nowhere. <br><br>Squatting, she smelled something chemical&#x2013;gasoline, like when you fill up your car and no matter how many times you wash your hands afterward you can&#x2019;t get rid of the stink. <br><br>A fuel leak? That&#x2019;s all she needed. <br><br>Six thousand miles and the car was nothing but problems. She&#x2019;d thought it was cool at first, but decided it was lame and stopped making payments. Hello, Re-po Man. Again. <br><br><i>We took care of the down payment, Katrina. All you had to do was remember on the fifteenth of each... </i><br>Where were the goddamn <i>keys</i>! She scraped her knuckles on the ground. A fake nail popped off and that made her feel like crying. <br><br>Ah, got it! <br><br>Struggling to her feet, she flicked the remote, dropped into the driver&#x2019;s seat, started up the engine. The car balked, then kicked in and <i>here we go Supergirl </i>she was driving straight into the black night&#x2013;oh, yeah, put on the headlights. <br><br>Slowly, with a drunk&#x2019;s exaggerated care, she coasted, missed the exit, backed up, passed through. Turning south onto Corinth Avenue, she made her way to Pico. The boulevard was totally empty and she turned onto it. Oversteered, ended up on the wrong side of the road, swerved and compensated, finally got the stupid car in the lane. <br><br>At Sepulveda, she hit a red light. <br><br>No cars at the intersection. No cops. <br><br>She ran it. <br><br>Sailing north, she felt free, like the whole city&#x2013;the whole <i>world </i>was hers. <br><br>Like someone had dropped a nuke and she was the last survivor. <br><br>Wouldn&#x2019;t <i>that </i>be cool, she could drive over to Beverly Hills, run a gazillion red lights, waltz into the Tiffany store on Rodeo and scoop up whatever she wanted. <br><br>A planet without people. She laughed. <br><br>She crossed Santa Monica and Wilshire and kept going until Sepulveda turned into the Pass. Off to her left was the 405, just a scatter of taillights. On the other side was hillside that bled into moonless sky. <br><br>No lights on in gazillion-dollar hill houses full of sleeping rich people. The same kind of idiots she had to deal with at La Femme. <br><br>Women like Mother, pretending they weren&#x2019;t shriveling or fat as pigs. <br><br>Thinking about work made Kat tense up and she deep-breathed. That made her burp real loud and she cracked up, drove faster. <br><br>At this rate, she&#x2019;d be over the hill and at her apartment real soon. <br><br>Stupid little dump in Van Nuys, but she told everyone it was Sherman Oaks because it was on the border and who cared? <br><br>All of a sudden her eyes began to close and she had to shake herself awake. A hard shove down on the gas pedal and the car shot forward. <br><br><i>Saaiiiling.... You go, girl! <br></i><br>Seconds later, the Mustang sputtered, whined, stopped. <br><br>She managed to steer to the right, stop just off the road. Let the car sit for a sec and tried again. <br><br>Nothing but a whiny noise. <br><br>Two more attempts, then five. <br><br><i>Shit! <br></i><br>It took a while to find the switch for the interior lights and when she brightened the car, her head hurt and she saw little yellow things dancing in front of her eyes. When they cleared, she looked at the gas gauge: <b>E </b><br><i>Shit shit shit! </i>How had that happened, she could swear&#x2013; <br><br>Mother&#x2019;s voice nagged at her. She put her hands over her ears and tried to think. <br><br>Where was the nearest gas station... nowhere, nothing for miles. <br><br>She punched the dashboard so hard it hurt her hands. Cried, sat back, drained. <br><br>Realizing she was exposed by the interior lights, she switched them off. <br><br>Now what? <br><br>Call the Triple A! Why hadn&#x2019;t she thought of that? <br><br>It took what seemed like a long time to find her cell phone in her purse. Even longer to locate her Triple A card. <br><br>Tapping out the toll-free number was hard because even with the phone light the numbers were teeny and her hands were shaky. <br><br>When the operator answered, she read off her membership code. Had to do it twice because her eyes had blurred and it was hard to see what was a 3 and what was an 8. <br><br>The operator put her on hold, came back and said her membership had lapsed. Kat said, &#x201c;No way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, ma&#x2019;am, but you haven&#x2019;t been active for eighteen months.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s frickin&#x2019; impossible&#x2013;&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, ma&#x2019;am, but&#x2013;&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Like hell you are&#x2013;&#x201d; &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, there&#x2019;s no reason to be&#x2013;&#x201d; &#x201c;Like hell there isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br><br>Kat clicked off. <i>Now </i>what? Think, think, think&#x2013;okay, plan B: Call Bethie&#x2019;s cell and if that interrupted something, too frickin&#x2019; bad. The phone rang five times before Bethie&#x2019;s voice mail kicked in. Kat hung up. Her phone went dead. Jabbing the <i>Power </i>button did nothing. That brought back a vague memory of something she&#x2019;d neglected. Charging up before she went out tonight&#x2013;how the <i>hell </i>had she forgotten? Now her whole <i>body </i>was shaking and her chest was tight and she was sweating. She double-checked to make sure the car was locked. Maybe a highway patrol dude would come by. What if another car did?<br> <br><i>Don&#x2019;t talk to strangers. <br></i><br>What was her choice, sleeping here all night?<br><br>She nearly fell asleep before the first car showed up, speeding toward her, headlights startling her. Big Range Rover; good. Kat waved out the window. Bastard sped right by. A couple of minutes later, headlights brightened her rearview and enlarged. This vehicle stopped right next to her. Crappy pickup, stuff piled in the back, under a tarp. The passenger window rolled down. Young Mexican guy.

Edited here by historian Belue, the book describes Boone's first penetrations into Kentucky, with a strong emphasis on Indian battles. The slim volume is fleshed out with some of the author's correspondence and lengthy endnotes. The narrative itself is inchoate and difficult for the uninitiated to follow, and the absence of chaptering or any other typographical breaks does not help. Although most of the individual episodes Houston describes are interesting, the lack of context and the brief portion of Boone's life covered will make most general readers long for a conventional biography.

His pace was brisk, and twice he glanced over his shoulder to assure himself that the street behind him was empty. The creak of the garden gate when he opened it was a welcome sound.</p><p>Only then did he relax his grip on the handle of the attach�case he was carrying. Since leaving Eyskens&#x2019;s office he&#x2019;d been holding it tightly, and he felt the prickle of pins and needles in his fingers now as he shifted the case to his left hand and fumbled in his pocket for his house key.</p><p>Normally he would have been brought home by car, but that morning he&#x2019;d paid off the last of the household staff, including his chauffeur, a blunt Breton by the name of Dugarry. Maurice had found the farewells upsetting and the sight of the darkened house as he walked up the gravel path to the front door was a reminder of the loss suffered by all parties. Florence, their cook, and a family retainer for the better part of a quarter of a century, had clung to his hand when they&#x2019;d said goodbye. There&#x2019;d been tears in her eyes.</p><p>&#x2018;Tell Madame . . .&#x2019; She had begun to speak three or four times, but been unable to continue. &#x2018;Ah, but you&#x2019;ll be back . . .&#x2019; It was all she could say.</p><p>Maurice had pressed her hand in return. &#x2018;Of course, of course . . .&#x2019; Not knowing if it was true. Not knowing if they would ever meet again.</p><p>With a sigh he unlocked the door and switched on the lights in the hall. The emptiness around him seemed unnatural - he was used to the house being filled with people, loud with the voices of family and friends - and he regretted, not for the first time, his decision to postpone his departure, when he could have taken passage on the same ship that had carried his wife and their two sons across the Atlantic to New York a month earlier. Unwisely, deceived by the slow march of events in Europe following the occupation of Poland, he&#x2019;d chosen to remain in Paris for a little while longer, taking time to dispose of his business and to attend to the many other details, such as the leasing of his house, which had required his attention. The delay had proved costly. He had not yet wound up his affairs when the long-threatened German invasion had been launched a week earlier, and with their armoured units advancing now with giant strides across the Low Countries and - according to as yet unconfirmed reports - about to encircle the French army entrenched on the Somme, he had been forced to take emergency measures, selling off the last of his stock at rock-bottom prices and, even worse, engaging in the kind of transaction he would normally have shunned in an attempt to salvage at least a portion of these assets.</p><p>On that last day - the last for him, at any rate - the city had worn an air of exhaustion. The soft breeze with its promise of spring had expired, like the hopes of so many, and it was the stifling heat of summer that hung in the air now and seemed poised to descend on streets already starting to empty as cars made their slow exit bumper to bumper from the capital in anticipation of the threat that daily drew closer. Although government spokesmen had said that every inch of French soil would be defended, Maurice knew from other sources - from the rumours that sped from mouth to mouth - that the German panzers were already moving south from the coast. He had glimpsed military lorries drawn up in lines outside ministries, prepared to cart away files and other vital equipment. And although no refugees had yet appeared in Paris, travellers arriving from the north-east spoke of roads clogged by those trying to escape the fighting; of whole families on the move pushing handcarts loaded with their possessions. More ominously still, there were even reports that French soldiers without their arms had joined the fleeing columns.</p><p>Although his appointment with Eyskens was not until the afternoon, Maurice had gone into the city earlier and after calling at his bank had paid a final visit to what had been until recently the store that bore his family&#x2019;s name: Sobel Fre&#x2018;res. Furriers of distinction, the shop was located off the rue St Honor�, and although Maurice had relinquished the lease on the property he still had a key to the street door. Wandering about the deserted rooms, he had felt a deep sadness. It had taken his family years to build up the business - the company had been founded by his grandfather - and its loss felt like an amputation. He could think of no sight more desolate that day than the rows of empty hangers where only a few weeks before the finest furs had been on display, no sign more indicative of abandonment and flight than the thin patina of dust already starting to gather on the glass-topped counters.</p><p>Seeking an antidote to his depression, he&#x2019;d chosen to lunch for the last time at a favourite restaurant in the rue Cambon, one he had patronized regularly over the years, where his face and name were known not only to the patron and waiters but also to some of the other clients, successful businessmen like himself, with whom he was accustomed to exchanging nods. No doubt some of them had heard of his decision to leave: he thought he detected sympathy in the glances cast his way. But for the most part they seemed preoccupied with their own affairs. (How could they not be?) They were taking stock of the new reality. And while there was little they could do to alter it, Maurice had nevertheless been distressed to observe the all too familiar hint of a shrug in their manner; that lift of the shoulders so peculiar to the French, signifying acceptance of a situation, however disagreeable.</p><p>Catching sight of his own image in a gold-framed mirror on the other side of the restaurant - wryly noting the elegance of his appearance, his silvered hair barbered to a millimetre, the distinction of his dark suit, one of several he&#x2019;d had tailored in London, its sombre hue set off by a splash of red silk spilling from his breast pocket - he&#x2019;d reflected on how little he differed from these pillars of the bourgeoisie, at least on the surface. How even now, he might have been pondering his country&#x2019;s future in the light of the fate that was about to overtake it: assessing what impact occupation by a foreign power would have on himself and his family, how best to protect his interests. In all probability the course of his life had not differed much from theirs. As a youth he had run up debts and made a fool of himself over women - to the despair of his father - but later redeemed himself by volunteering to serve in the war which only a generation earlier had bled his country white, and being twice decorated for gallantry. He had married well and raised a family.</p><p>But none of that mattered any longer, he knew, none of it counted. The future lay with the jackbooted conquerors whose armoured units even now were beating a path to the city&#x2019;s gates, and they would not be deceived.</p><p>A Jew was a Jew.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Willem Eyskens&#x2019;s office, or rather his place of business, since buying and selling were very much part of his day-to-day operations, was located off the rue de Rivoli. The brass plate beside the locked door bore his name, but gave no further information. Indeed, if you were not expected there in all likelihood you were not welcome, and beyond the door, which was only opened after the caller had adequately identified himself, access was further barred by a guard, presumably armed, who sat at a table in the small entrance hall with an alarm button close at hand. Maurice had been given Eyskens&#x2019;s name by a business associate, a dealer in costume jewellery and other fashion accessories with whom he did business from time to time.</p><p>&#x2018;He&#x2019;s a diamond broker with connections in Amsterdam. Dutch originally, but he&#x2019;s been settled here a long time. He only deals in good-quality stones, I&#x2019;ve been told, and he&#x2019;s discreet. He can certainly provide what you need - at a price, of course.&#x2019;</p><p>The price, as it turned out, had been high. Eyskens had outlined the cruel economics of it at their first meeting. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s always the same in dangerous times. People try to save what they have. You can&#x2019;t take a factory with you, a business. So you turn it into something you know has value. Gold, if you can carry enough of it; otherwise stones. Diamonds. There&#x2019;s no need to explain what effect this demand has on the market.&#x2019;</p><p>A thin-faced man with red cheeks and fair hair brushed back from his forehead, Eyskens had kept his gaze on the surface of his rosewood desk while he spoke. It was as though he was embarrassed to meet Maurice&#x2019;s gaze.</p><p>&#x2018;Sufficient to say you are not the first to come to me with a request of this kind, Monsieur Sobel. These are, as I say, terrible times. Let us be businesslike. Your need is urgent, I see that. The short notice makes for difficulties, but I can provide what you want. However, I would prefer if this were a cash transaction.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You don&#x2019;t want a cheque?&#x2019; Maurice hadn&#x2019;t been altogether surprised.</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s not a matter of trust, I assure you. Your reputation is beyond question.&#x2019; Eyskens had shown small signs of discomfort. &#x2018;But I will be forced to cut corners, if I can put it like that. And later on questions may be asked - I don&#x2019;t mean by the French authorities. Paris may soon be under new rulers, men who might wish to enquire into favours done for . . . for . . .&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Jews?&#x2019; Maurice had furnished the word he was trying not to utter.</p><p>&#x2018;I am sorry . . .&#x2019; Eyskens had spread his hands on the desk.</p><p>Their first meeting had taken place the previous week, and that afternoon, having earlier withdrawn the cash from his bank - Maurice had given Eyskens a round figure to work with - he had proceeded to their final appointment. Once again he&#x2019;d been shown upstairs to the diamond broker&#x2019;s office, a small, windowless room, bare of decoration, where Eyskens was waiting. Before him on the desk was a black velvet bag tied with a drawstring. It lay on a piece of felt which had been spread across the desk. Beside the bag was a jeweller&#x2019;s loupe.</p><p>&#x2018;I will leave you now.&#x2019; Eyskens rose. &#x2018;You will want to examine the stones. Please take your time. I have made a list&#x2019; - he took a piece of paper from his jacket pocket and handed it to Maurice. &#x2018;The stones are marked by weight, but you will be able to tell by the size and the shape which is which. Taken together they match the sum we agreed on. Of course, if any of them doesn&#x2019;t meet with your approval, it can be discarded and we will make the necessary adjustment to the total.&#x2019; He bowed and left the room.</p><p>Maurice had wasted no time. Uncomfortable though the transaction made him feel, he had taken a decision and meant to stick to it. With the start of the war, the movement of funds by more orthodox means had become increasingly difficult and the German invasion had brought even those to a halt. True, in the past few months he had managed to shift a good portion of his assets abroad, but he was reluctant to leave anything he possessed to the new masters of Europe, these brutal despoilers of his people.</p><p>Emptying the velvet bag on to the felt, he had examined the glittering contents. Though no expert, his experience as a furrier had made him familiar with all aspects of the fashion trade, including its most luxurious and costly items, and a few minutes&#x2019; study with the loupe were enough to reassure him of the quality of the goods he was purchasing. The bag contained a score of diamonds - cut stones, as he&#x2019;d requested - the biggest the size of his thumbnail, all of the finest water.</p><p>By the time the broker returned ten minutes later, Maurice had emptied the attach� case, which had been resting on the floor at his feet, and laid out the stacks of banknotes he had brought in a neat pile alongside the diamonds.</p><p>&#x2018;You are satisfied, then?&#x2019; Eyskens resumed his position across the desk.</p><p>&#x2018;Perfectly.&#x2019;</p><p>Maurice was relieved that their business was over. For some reason - its hole-in-the-wall nature, perhaps - he&#x2019;d found it distasteful. Nor had he warmed to the man who sat facing him. The Dutchman&#x2019;s pale blue eyes were unreadable.</p><p>&#x2018;Would you like to count the money, Monsieur Eyskens?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Given who I am dealing with, that will not be necessary.&#x2019; The broker had accompanied these words with a polite bow. They both rose.</p><p>&#x2018;Goodbye, Monsieur Sobel. I wish you good fortune.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was nothing more he could do. Everything was set now for his departure the following morning, and as he wandered about the house switching on lights, Maurice went over the plans he&#x2019;d made, plans which had grown in complication as the situation around him became more unstable. With sailings from Le Havre suspended, he&#x2019;d been obliged to look further afield and had managed to book passage on a liner leaving Lisbon for New York in a week&#x2019;s time. This had still left him with the problem of getting to the Portuguese capital, and having considered - and discarded - the idea of trying to find a seat on the by now overcrowded trains heading south from the city daily, he had decided instead to make the long journey by motor car.</p><p>Dugarry&#x2019;s last job before departing to join his wife and children in Rennes had been to service the Sobels&#x2019; Citro�n cabriolet and to ensure that the tyres were in good condition and reserve supplies of fuel stowed aboard. Even so, Maurice might have felt daunted by the thought of the drive ahead - apart from the odd Sunday outing it was some years since he had driven a car - had it not been for a stroke of good fortune that had come his way a few days earlier. An acquaintance of his, a Polish art dealer called Kinski, long settled in France, had rung him out of the blue to ask, if it was not prying, if it was not an indelicate question, whether what he had heard was true - that Sobel was intending to quit Paris and would be travelling to Spain in his car? Before Maurice had time to get over his surprise - he had discussed his plans with only one or two people - Kinski had revealed the reason for his enquiry.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ve been asked if I can help a young man whom the Nazis would like to get their hands on.

Published in 1988, the year after he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, this collection features pieces translated by the poet himself and others, as well as poems written originally in English.</p><p>Auden once characterized Brodsky as "a traditionalist . . . interested in what lyric poets of all ages have been interested in . . . encounters with nature . . . reflections upon the human condition, death, and the meaning of existence." Reading the poems in <i>To Urania</i>--by turns cerebral, caustic, comic, and celebratory--we appreciate firsthand a great lyric poet's variety and achievement.</p></p><p><p>The poet, essayist, and playwright <b>Joseph Brodsky</b> (1940-96) came to the United States in 1972, an involuntary exile from the Soviet Union. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1987 and served as Poet Laureate of the United States in 1991 and 1992.</p>Nobel Prize-winner Brodsky is one of the Soviet Union's most distinguished exiles, and evidently the experience has affected him deeply. Having "munched the bread of exile: . . . stale and warty," he knows that "every thing has a limit;/ . . . for despair, it is memory." Indeed, the sense of loss is pervasive, as is the search for permanence. In the remarkable "Lithuanian Nocturne," which finds the poet's specter crossing oceans to visit his confrere Thomas Venclova, Brodsky may see poetry's realm as "the kingdom of air," but his poems are in fact dense with accumulated detail, as if to reassure him that "nothing has changed here." Brodsky's first collection since A Part of Speech ( LJ 8/80 ) , this volume contains previously uncollected works dating from 1968 (e.g., the 1400-line "Gorbunov and Gorchakov") but written mostly in this decade.

He lives with his wife, the novelist Tabitha King, in Bangor, Maine.<b>JERUSALEM'S LOT</b><br><br>Oct. 2, 1850.<br><br>DEAR BONES,<br><br>How good it was to step into the cold, draughty hall here at Chapelwaite, every bone in an ache from that abominable coach, in need of instant relief from my distended bladder&#x2014;and to see a letter addressed in your own inimitable scrawl propped on the obscene little cherry-wood table beside the door! Be assured that I set to deciphering it as soon as the needs of the body were attended to (in a coldly ornate downstairs bathroom where I could see my breath rising before my eyes).<br><br>I'm glad to hear that you are recovered from the <i>miasma</i> that has so long set in your lungs, although I assure you that I do sympathize with the moral dilemma the cure has affected you with. An ailing abolitionist healed by the sunny climes of slave-struck Florida! Still and all, Bones, I ask you as a friend who has also walked in the valley of the shadow, <i>to take all care of yourself </i>and venture not back to Massachusetts until your body gives you leave. Your fine mind and incisive pen cannot serve us if you are clay, and if the Southern zone is a healing one, is there not poetic justice in that?<br><br>Yes, the house is quite as fine as I had been led to believe by my cousin's executors, but rather more sinister. It sits atop a huge and jutting point of land perhaps three miles north of Falmouth and nine miles north of Portland. Behind it are some four acres of grounds, gone back to the wild in the most formidable manner imaginable&#x2014;junipers, scrub vines, bushes, and various forms of creeper climb wildly over the picturesque stone walls that separate the estate from the town domain. Awful imitations of Greek statuary peer blindly through the wrack from atop various hillocks&#x2014;they seem, in most cases, about to lunge at the passer-by. My cousin Stephen's tastes seem to have run the gamut from the unacceptable to the downright horrific. There is an odd little summer house which has been nearly buried in scarlet sumac and a grotesque sundial in the midst of what must once have been a garden. It adds the final lunatic touch.<br><br>But the view from the parlour more than excuses this; I command a dizzying view of the rocks at the foot of Chapelwaite Head and the Atlantic itself. A huge, bellied bay window looks out on this, and a huge, toadlike secretary stands beside it. It will do nicely for the start of that novel which I have talked of so long [and no doubt tiresomely].<br><br>To-day has been gray with occasional splatters of rain. As I look out all seems to be a study in slate&#x2014;the rocks, old and worn as Time itself, the sky, and of course the sea, which crashes against the granite fangs below with a sound which is not precisely sound but vibration&#x2014;I can feel the waves with my feet even as I write. The sensation is not a wholly unpleasant one.<br><br>I know you disapprove my solitary habits, dear Bones, but I assure you that I am fine and happy. Calvin is with me, as practical, silent, and as dependable as ever, and by midweek I am sure that between the two of us we shall have straightened our affairs and made arrangement for necessary deliveries from town&#x2014;and a company of cleaning women to begin blowing the dust from this place!<br><br>I will close&#x2014;there are so many things as yet to be seen, rooms to explore, and doubtless a thousand pieces of execrable furniture to be viewed by these tender eyes. Once again, my thanks for the touch of familiar brought by your letter, and for your continuing regard.<br><br>Give my love to your wife, as you both have mine.<br><br>CHARLES.<br>Oct. 6, 1850.<br><br>DEAR BONES,<br><br>Such a place this is!<br><br>It continues to amaze me&#x2014;as do the reactions of the townfolk in the closest village to my occupancy. That is a queer little place with the picturesque name of Preacher's Corners. It was there that Calvin contracted for the weekly provisions. The other errand, that of securing a sufficient supply of cordwood for the winter, was likewise taken care of. But Cal returned with gloomy countenance, and when I asked him what the trouble was, he replied grimly enough:<br><br>"They think you mad, Mr. Boone!"<br><br>I laughed and said that perhaps they had heard of the brain fever I suffered after my Sarah died&#x2014;certainly I spoke madly enough at that time, as you could attest.<br><br>But Cal protested that no-one knew anything of me except through my cousin Stephen, who contracted for the same services as I have now made provision for. "What was said, sir, was that anyone who would live in Chapelwaite must be either a lunatic or run the risk of becoming one."<br><br>This left me utterly perplexed, as you may imagine, and I asked who had given him this amazing communication. He told me that he had been referred to a sullen and rather besotted pulp-logger named Thompson, who owns four hundred acres of pine, birch, and spruce, and who logs it with the help of his five sons, for sale to the mills in Portland and to householders in the immediate area.<br><br>When Cal, all unknowing of his queer prejudice, gave him the location to which the wood was to be brought, this Thompson stared at him with his mouth ajaw and said that he would send his sons with the wood, in the good light of the day, and by the sea road.<br><br>Calvin, apparently misreading my bemusement for distress, hastened to say that the man reeked of cheap whiskey and that he had then lapsed into some kind of nonsense about a deserted village and cousin Stephen's relations&#x2014;and worms! Calvin finished his business with one of Thompson's boys, who, I take it, was rather surly and none too sober or freshly-scented himself. I take it there has been some of this reaction in Preacher's Corners itself, at the general store where Cal spoke with the shop-keeper, although this was more of the gossipy, behind-the-hand type.<br><br>None of this has bothered me much; we know how rustics dearly love to enrich their lives with the smell of scandal and myth, and I suppose poor Stephen and his side of the family are fair game. As I told Cal, a man who has fallen to his death almost from his own front porch is more than likely to stir talk.<br><br>The house itself is a constant amazement. Twenty-three rooms, Bones! The wainscotting which panels the upper floors and the portrait gallery is mildewed but still stout. While I stood in my late cousin's upstairs bedroom I could hear the rats scuttering behind it, and big ones they must be, from the sound they make&#x2014;almost like people walking there. I should hate to encounter one in the dark; or even in the light, for that matter. Still, I have noted neither holes nor droppings. Odd.<br><br>The upper gallery is lined with bad portraits in frames which must be worth a fortune. Some bear a resemblance to Stephen as I remember him. I believe I have correctly identified my Uncle Henry Boone and his wife Judith; the others are unfamiliar. I suppose one of them may be my own notorious grandfather, Robert. But Stephen's side of the family is all but unknown to me, for which I am heartily sorry. The same good humour that shone in Stephen's letters to Sarah and me, the same light of high intellect, shines in these portraits, bad as they are. For what foolish reasons families fall out! A rifled <i>escritoire</i>, hard words between brothers now dead three generations, and blameless descendants are needlessly estranged. I cannot help reflecting upon how fortunate it was that you and John Petty succeeded in contacting Stephen when it seemed I might follow my Sarah through the Gates&#x2014;and upon how unfortunate it was that chance should have robbed us of a face-to-face meeting. How I would have loved to hear him defend the ancestral statuary and furnishings!<br><br>But do not let me denigrate the place to an extreme. Stephen's taste was not my own, true, but beneath the veneer of his additions there are pieces [a number of them shrouded by dust-covers in the upper chambers] which are true masterworks. There are beds, tables, and heavy, dark scrollings done in teak and mahogany, and many of the bedrooms and receiving chambers, the upper study and small parlour, hold a somber charm. The floors are rich pine that glow with an inner and secret light. There is dignity here; dignity and the weight of years. I cannot yet say I like it, but I do respect it. I am eager to watch it change as we revolve through the changes of this northern clime.<br><br>Lord, I run on! Write soon, Bones. Tell me what progress you make, and what news you hear from Petty and the rest. And please do not make the mistake of trying to persuade any new Southern acquaintances as to your views <i>too forcibly</i>&#x2014;I understand that not all are content to answer merely with their mouths, as is our long-winded <i>friend</i>, Mr. Calhoun.<br><br>Yr. affectionate friend,<br><br>CHARLES.<br>Oct. 16, 1850.<br><br>DEAR RICHARD,<br><br>Hello, and how are you? I have thought about you often since I have taken up residence here at Chapelwaite, and had half-expected to hear from you&#x2014;and now I receive a letter from Bones telling me that I'd forgotten to leave my address at the club! Rest assured that I would have written eventually anyway, as it sometimes seems that my true and loyal friends are all I have left in the world that is sure and completely normal. And, Lord, how spread we've become! You in Boston, writing faithfully for <i>The Liberator</i> [to which I have also sent my address, incidentally], Hanson in England on another of his confounded<i> jaunts</i>, and poor old Bones in the very <i>lions' lair</i>, recovering his lungs.<br><br>It goes as well as can be expected here, Dick, and be assured I will render you a full account when I am not quite as pressed by certain events which are extant here&#x2014;I think your legal mind may be quite intrigued by certain happenings at Chapelwaite and in the area about it.<br><br>But in the meantime I have a favour to ask, if you will entertain it. Do you remember the historian you introduced me to at Mr. Clary's fund-raising dinner for the cause? I believe his name was Bigelow. At any rate, he mentioned that he made a hobby of collecting odd bits of historical lore which pertained to the very area in which I am now living. My favour, then, is this: Would you contact him and ask him what facts, bits of folklore, or <i>general rumour</i>&#x2014;if any&#x2014;he may be conversant with about a small, deserted village called JERUSALEM'S LOT, near a township called Preacher's Corners, on the Royal River? The stream itself is a tributary of the Androscoggin, and flows into that river approximately eleven miles above that river's emptying place near Chapelwaite. It would gratify me intensely, and, more important, may be a matter of some moment.<br><br>In looking over this letter I feel I have been a bit short with you, Dick, for which I am heartily sorry. But be assured I will explain myself shortly, and until that time I send my warmest regards to your wife, two fine sons, and, of course, to yourself.<br><br>Yr. affectionate friend,<br><br>CHARLES.<br>Oct. 16, 1850.<br><br>DEAR BONES,<br><br>I have a tale to tell you which seems a little strange [and even disquieting] to both Cal and me&#x2014;see what you think. If nothing else, it may serve to amuse you while you battle the mosquitoes!<br><br>Two days after I mailed my last to you, a group of four young ladies arrived from the Corners under the supervision of an elderly lady of intimidatingly-competent visage named Mrs. Cloris, to set the place in order and to remove some of the dust that had been causing me to sneeze seemingly at every other step. They all seemed a little nervous as they went about their chores; indeed, one flighty miss uttered a small screech when I entered the upstairs parlour as she dusted.<br><br>I asked Mrs. Cloris about this [she was dusting the downstairs hall with grim determination that would have quite amazed you, her hair done up in an old faded bandanna], and she turned to me and said with an air of determination: "They don't like the house, and I don't like the house, sir, because it has always been a <i>bad</i> house."<br><br>My jaw dropped at this unexpected bit, and she went on in a kindlier tone: "I do not mean to say that Stephen Boone was not a fine man, for he was; I cleaned for him every second Thursday all the time he was here, as I cleaned for his father, Mr. Randolph Boone, until he and his wife disappeared in eighteen and sixteen. Mr. Stephen was a good and kindly man, and so you seem, sir (if you will pardon my bluntness; I know no other way to speak), but the house is <i>bad</i> and it always <i>has been</i>, and no Boone has ever been happy here since your grandfather Robert and his brother Philip fell out over stolen [and here she paused, almost guiltily] items in seventeen and eighty-nine."<br><br>Such memories these folks have, Bones!<br><br>Mrs. Cloris continued: "The house was built in unhappiness, has been lived in with unhappiness, there has been blood spilt on its floors [as you may or may not know, Bones, my Uncle Randolph was involved in an accident on the cellar stairs which took the life of his daughter Marcella; he then took his own life in a fit of remorse. The incident is related in one of Stephen's letters to me, on the sad occasion of his dead sister's birthday], there has been disappearance and accident.<br><br>"I have worked here, Mr. Boone, and I am neither blind nor deaf. I've heard awful sounds in the walls, sir, awful sounds&#x2014;thumpings and crashings and once a strange wailing that was half-laughter. It fair made my blood curdle. It's a dark place, sir." And there she halted, perhaps afraid she had spoken too much.<br><br>As for myself, I hardly knew whether to be offended or amused, curious or merely matter-of-fact. I'm afraid that amusement won the day. "And what do you suspect, Mrs. Cloris? Ghosts rattling chains?"<br><br>But she only looked at me oddly. "Ghosts there may be. But it's not ghosts in the walls. It's not ghosts that wail and blubber like the damned and crash and blunder away in the darkness. It's&#x2014;"<br><br>"Come, Mrs. Cloris," I prompted her. "You've come this far. Now can you finish what you've begun?"<br><br>The strangest expression of terror, pique, and-I would swear to it&#x2014;religious awe passed over her face. "Some die not," she whispered. "Some live in the twilight shadows Between to serve&#x2014;Him!"</p><h2>High Society: The Life of Grace Kelly</h2><p>Drawing on his unprecedented access to Grace Kelly, bestselling biographer Donald Spoto at last offers an intimate, honest, and authoritative portrait of one of Hollywood&#x2019;s legendary actresses.<br>In just seven years&#x2013;from 1950 through 1956&#x2013;Grace Kelly embarked on a whirlwind career that included roles in eleven movies. From the principled Amy Fowler Kane in <i>High Noon</i> to the thrill-seeking Frances Stevens of <i>To Catch a Thief</i>, Grace established herself as one of Hollywood&#x2019;s most talented actresses and iconic beauties. Her astonishing career lasted until her retirement at age twenty-six, when she withdrew from stage and screen to marry a European monarch and became a modern, working princess and mother. <br><br>Based on never-before-published or quoted interviews with Grace and those conducted over many years with her friends and colleagues&#x2013;from costars James Stewart and Cary Grant to director Alfred Hitchcock&#x2013;as well as many documents disclosed by her children for the first time, acclaimed biographer Donald Spoto explores the transformation of a convent schoolgirl to New York model, successful television actress, Oscar-winning movie star, and beloved royal. <br><br>As the princess requested, Spoto waited twenty-five years after her death to write this biography. Now, with honesty and insight, <i>High Society</i> reveals the truth of Grace Kelly&#x2019;s personal life, the men she loved, the men she didn&#x2019;t, and what lay behind the fa�ade of her fairy-tale life.</p><p>DONALD SPOTO is the author of twenty-five books, including bestselling biographies of Alfred Hitchcock, Tennessee Williams, Laurence Olivier, Marlene Dietrich, Ingrid Bergman, and Audrey Hepburn. He earned his Ph.D. degree from Fordham University. Spoto is married to the Danish school administrator Ole Flemming Larsen; they live in a quiet village, an hour&#x2019;s drive from Copenhagen.One: Off the Main Line<br><br>I never really felt pretty, bright or socially adept.&#x2014;Grace<br>In the late 1920s, the Hahnemann Medical College, at the corner of Broad and Vine Streets in Philadelphia, was one of the largest private hospitals in the United States. Unusual luxuries characterized the private rooms: a telephone and radio were installed at every bedside; nurses could be summoned and addressed by call-buttons and two-way speakers; and high-speed elevators whisked visitors to the wards. Although Hahnemann accepted emergency cases from every socioeconomic class, it catered, unofficially but famously, to the demands of the rich from the counties of eastern Pennsylvania.<br>Early in the morning of Tuesday, November 12, 1929, John B. Kelly escorted his wife, Margaret Majer Kelly, to Hahnemann, where, after an unexceptional labor, she bore her third child and second daughter. On December 1, the Kellys took the baby to St. Bridget&#x2019;s Roman Catholic Church, a three-minute, half-mile drive from their home in the upscale neighborhood of Philadelphia known as East Falls. The infant was baptized Grace Patricia, in memory of an aunt who had died young, and (so Grace Kelly believed) &#x201c;because I was Tuesday&#x2019;s child&#x201d;&#x2014;who, according to Mother Goose, was &#x201c;full of grace.&#x201d;<br><br>On the banks of the Schuylkill River, East Falls has always been a quiet residential neighborhood, known for its easy commute to downtown Philadelphia. The most respected, established families&#x2014;Protestants with &#x201c;old money&#x201d; like the Drexels, Biddles, Clarks, Cadwaladers and Wideners&#x2014;lived across the river, in western suburbs along the ?so-?called Main Line, in eighteen communities (among them, Overbrook, Merion, Wynnewood, Ardmore, Haverford, Bryn Mawr, Rosemont and Radnor). The river was very like a social dividing line.<br><br>But membership in Philadelphia&#x2019;s �lite depended more on history than geography: one was &#x201c;in society&#x201d; only if a family could be traced back to colonial times, before the War of Independence. The class distinctions were so immutable that the Kellys knew they would never be accepted into high society, no matter the extent of their wealth. The Kellys were Irish, Roman Catholic and Democrats; Philadelphia society was English, Episcopalian and Republican. &#x201c;We could have been members&nbsp;of the social register&#x2014;the so-called Four Hundred&#x2014;if we&#x2019;d wanted to,&#x201d; Grace Kelly&#x2019;s mother said. &#x201c;But we had other things to do.&#x201d; If she really believed this, she was astonishingly na�ve. Her husband knew otherwise; instead, he set out to &#x201c;do well&#x201d; in business, athletics and politics.<br><br>When Grace was born, the entire country was in the throes of a terrible financial crisis. At the end of October the stock market was in almost total collapse, signaling an economic disaster that led to the Great Depression. Scores of banks failed overnight; innumerable companies shut their doors forever; and millions of Americans were suddenly homeless and jobless, pitchforked into abject poverty and facing a future without prospects. The United States was steeped in despair, and newspapers chronicled a tragic epidemic of suicides.<br>Some families, however, were untouched by the gruesome facts of national life, and Grace&#x2019;s was among them. Her father, John B. Kelly, had never speculated in the stock market, and his wealth&#x2014;achieved in the construction trade during the boom time after the Great War&#x2014;was held in cash and government bonds. His seventeen-room brick mansion at 3901 Henry Avenue was set amid lush, undulating lawns, and the property featured a tennis court and elaborate recreational equipment for active children. The house was mortgage-free, like Kelly&#x2019;s seaside vacation home in Ocean City, New Jersey. The family sailed through the Depression enjoying a genteel, privileged life: the Kelly children attended private academies; there were household servants and workers to tend the grounds and gardens; and the children wore only the finest new seasonal wardrobes.<br><br>Grace had two older siblings: Margaret (&#x201c;Peggy&#x201d;), born in September 1925; and John junior (&#x201c;Kell&#x201d;), born in May 1927. The family was complete with the birth of Elizabeth Anne (&#x201c;Lizanne&#x201d;) in June 1933. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t a strong child like my sisters and brother,&#x201d; Grace said years later, &#x201c;and my family told me they thought I was practically born with a cold&#x2014;I was always sniffling and sneezing, clearing my throat and fighting some kind of respiratory ailment.&#x201d; Her mother routinely reserved the juices of the family roasts for fragile young Grace, in a constant effort to improve the child&#x2019;s strength and stamina.<br><br>&#x201c;My other children were the strong ones, the extroverts, but Gracie was shy and retiring,&#x201d; her mother recalled. &#x201c;She was also frail and sickly a good deal of the time.&#x201d; The girl filled the hours of her frequent confinements by making up stories and plays for her collection of dolls. &#x201c;Grace could change her voice for each doll, giving it a different character. She loved attention for all this, but she didn&#x2019;t cry if she didn&#x2019;t get it.&#x201d;<br><br>Thin and withdrawn, Grace preferred to read myths, fairy tales and books about dancers and dancing; indeed, her favorite dolls were fashioned like tiny ballerinas, complete with pointe shoes and delicate tutus. She also loved to read poetry and tried her hand at verses:<br>I hate to see the sun go downAnd squeeze itself into the ground,Since some warm night it might get stuckAnd in the morning not get up!<br>Grace was largely indifferent to physical activity: &#x201c;I liked to swim, but did my best to avoid other sports and games.&#x201d; This attitude made her something of an outsider. Her father had been an Olympic athlete, her mother a champion swimmer and physical education teacher, and their children were strongly&nbsp;encouraged&#x2014;indeed, they were expected&#x2014;to excel at competitive sports. Grace&#x2019;s preference for books and imaginative games did not go down well with her father, a man who had little interest in cultural or intellectual matters.<br><br>Born in 1889, John B. &#x201c;Jack&#x201d; Kelly was the youngest of ten children born to Irish immigrants. Quitting school in early adolescence, he worked in the family firm as a bricklayer while perfecting his skill at sculling (rowing on the river), and during army service in the World War, he became a champion boxer. Returning to civilian life, Jack rejoined his father&#x2019;s company, Kelly for Brickwork, and the postwar building boom of the 1920s quickly made him a millionaire. He did not, however, achieve this on his own, as he often implied, nor was he a self-made American success story. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve latched on to the bricklayer theme and won&#x2019;t let go of this Horatio Alger idea,&#x201d; said his brother George, who directly confronted Jack&#x2019;s self-glorification. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s all this talk about you getting callused hands laying bricks? The only times I remember you having calluses were from long hours of scull practice on the Schuylkill River!&#x201d;<br>Wealth freed Jack to spend those long hours rowing. After winning six national championships, he headed for the Henley Regatta in England, the most celebrated event in the sport of sculling. But in 1920 his application for inclusion was rejected at the last minute when the judges determined that his years of manual labor and muscular development as a bricklayer gave him an unfair advantage over &#x201c;gentleman&#x201d; athletes. The true reason for his dismissal, however, was that the English authorities did not want to risk giving a prize to an Irish-American Catholic. The consequential outcry was so loud that by 1937 the rules at Henley no longer excluded manual laborers, mechanics or artisans as unfit for the competition.<br><br>More determined than ever after this rejection, Kelly proceeded to the 1920 summer Olympics at Antwerp, Belgium, where he won a gold medal in the single scull and, half an hour later, a second gold medal in the double scull, in which he rowed with a cousin. His family later swore to the truth of the anecdote that he mailed his racing cap to King George V with the message, &#x201c;Greetings from a bricklayer.&#x201d; Four years later, during the summer of 1924, Kelly and his cousin repeated their success at the Paris Olympics&#x2014;an achievement that made &#x201c;the Irish bricklayer&#x201d; the first rower to win three Olympic gold medals. With that, he became one of the most famous athletes of his generation, and his name was included in the United States Olympic Hall of Fame. Later he was appointed National Physical Fitness Director by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who regarded him as a good friend.<br><br>Before his Paris triumph, Kelly renounced bachelorhood (but not his avocation as a womanizer) when he married Margaret Majer on January 30, 1924, at St. Bridget&#x2019;s Church. She was nine years his junior and as strikingly beautiful as he was darkly handsome. They had first met at a swim club, where she successfully competed; she was also one of Philadelphia&#x2019;s most successful cover-girl models. With her degree in physical education, she became the first woman to teach that field at the University of Pennsylvania and at Women&#x2019;s Medical College. She converted from Lutheranism to her fianc�&#x2019;s religion just before their wedding.<br><br>&#x201c;I had a good stiff German background,&#x201d; Margaret said years later. &#x201c;My parents believed in discipline and so do I&#x2014;no tyranny or anything like that, but a certain firmness.&#x201d; Proper appearances, unfailing decorum, the importance of manners: these were almost religious observances for Margaret Majer Kelly. She trained her children to control themselves, to hide pain and disappointment, to suppress their emotions in public, to disguise effort and to strive for perfection without seeming to do so.

Through a series of memorable dinner parties, picnics, and Sunday brunches, Segal evokes the subtle drama and humor of the outsider&#x2019;s loneliness, the comfort and charm of familiar companionship, the bliss of being in love, and the strangeness of our behavior in the face of other people&#x2019;s deaths.</p><p>A magnificent and deeply moving work, <i>Shakespeare&#x2019;s Kitchen</i> marks the long&#x2013;awaited return of a writer at the height of her powers.</p></p><p>Lore Segal was born in Vienna and educated at the University of London. The author of <i>Other People&#x2019;s Houses</i>, <i>Her First American</i>, and <i>Shakespeare&#x2019;s Kitchen</i> (all published by The New Press) and other works, she is a regular contributor to the <i>New Yorker</i>, the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>, the <i>New Republic</i>, and other publications. Between 1968 and 1996 she taught writing at Columbia University&#x2019;s School of the Arts, Princeton University, Bennington College, Sarah Lawrence College, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Ohio State University, from which she retired in 1996.<i>Starred Review.</i> What began as seven interrelated short stories published in The New Yorker (including the O'Henry Prize-winning "The Reverse Bug") is now a full-length collection of thirteen?the first major work of fiction in 20 years from the acclaimed author of Her First American. Filled with all the pomp and depressed glory of a modern-day Great Gatsby, each installment delivers an entertaining glimpse into the dysfunctional lives of a group of hoity-toity Connecticut think tank intellectuals as they philosophize over wine and cheese, fall in and out of love and go about their daily lives with reckless abandon. Most of the action takes place (or is retold, properly discussed and drunkenly digested) in the kitchen of the institute's director, Leslie Shakespeare, while Leslie's wife alternatively entertains and lambastes their friends. Although the plot centers on nothing more than everyday comings and goings, Segal gives readers a peek into the sausage factory of daily routine, in which humdrum-but-necessary minutia belie the intrigue and angst stirred up in her self-absorbed characters' internal monologues. When stacked together, these vignettes are hilarious and telling. Segal exhibits a rare insight into the human character that is at once humbling and shamelessly enjoyable to behold. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He has written about a hundred books, all but two or three of them good. People who own radios may know Daniel Pinkwater as a popular commentator and children&#x2019;s book reviewer on National Public Radio. At one time, he lived in Los Angeles, went to a fancy private school with the children of movie stars, and ate in The Hat numerous times. He lives with his wife, the illustrator and novelist Jill Pinkwater, and several dogs and cats in a very old farmhouse in New York&#x2019;s Hudson River Valley.<br>We Take the Train I didn&#x2019;t always live here. And by here&#x201d; I do not mean the La Brea Tar Pits, where I am writing this down in a notebook I mean Los Angeles. When I was a little kid I lived in Chicago.<br>On Wilshire Boulevard, in Los Angeles, there is a restaurant shaped like a hat. It is called the Brown Derby, and that&#x2019;s what it looks like one of those derby hats, with the round top and the little brim all around. There is a sign outside that says eat in the hat. And people do. I knew about this because I saw pictures in Look magazine. The pictures showed the restaurant, the eat in the hat sign, and two movie stars I think it was Bette Davis and Laird Cregar inside the hat, eating cheeseburgers. They were eating cheeseburgers with knives and forks! This was interesting too. I had only found out about cheeseburgers a short time before and had actually eaten only two of them. I did not know that some people eat them with knives and forks, but I thought of them as grown-up and sophisticated food even before learning that movie stars ate them.<br>Anyway, when I read about the Brown Derby and saw the pictures, it became one of my life&#x2019;s ambitions to eat there. I have to confess, I was not clear about exactly where Los Angeles, California, was if it was not too far, maybe I could get my father to drive us over one day in the Buick.<br>So I mentioned it to my father, and I learned two things. I learned that Los Angeles, California, of which Hollywood is a part (the reason that movie stars eat in the Brown Derby), was way out West, and it took more than two days to get there by train.<br>The other thing I learned . . . Well, this is what my father said: Neddie, my boy! It is also my lifelong ambition to eat in the restaurant shaped like a hat!&#x201d; And this is what he said next: Not only will we eat in the hat, we will all go and live in Los Angeles, California! We can eat in the hat all the time, and pick lemons off the trees, and live in the sunshine.&#x201d; A week later, we had packed up our clothes, moving men had come and taken away the furniture, I had said goodbye to my friends forever, and my father, my mother, and my sister, Eloise, and I were on the Super Chief, which is a fancy deluxe train that goes from Chicago to Los Angeles.<br>You might think there was something weird about my family my father, anyway and there is. He is unpredictable and tends to do things that surprise people, until they get used to him. My mother seems normal at first, but she&#x2019;s married to him and always goes along with his ideas like the parakeets, for instance. I bought a parakeet for ninety-nine cents at the dime store. Little blue parakeet. I named him Henry. At the back of the dime store they have this pet department: goldfish, canaries, and parakeets. The usual price for parakeets is a dollar and a half, but they sell the shrimpy ones for ninety-nine cents. A dinky wire cage costs twenty-five cents, and the guy in the pet department threw in a box of birdseed for free. My father thought Henry was the greatest thing he&#x2019;d ever seen, and a week later he came home with eleven more, a big cage with a parakeet playground, ladders and bells and perches and mirrors, a book on parakeet care, and bags and bags of stuff for them to eat. After a week of playing with the parakeets and reading up on them, he made it my job to take care of them: clean the cage, spray them for mites, smear Vaseline on their feet also, I was supposed to train them to hop onto my finger, and teach them to talk. The talking never worked out probably because we had so many of them. The book said that in order to teach a parakeet to talk, you needed to isolate it and repeat whatever word you wanted it to learn while it was going to sleep at night, and again the first thing in the morning. With a dozen parakeets, they just talked to one another, chirping and whistling and screaming.<br>I didn&#x2019;t mind being the family parakeet-keeper, but it was a lot of work. Also, I felt sorry for my parakeet, Henry, because all my father&#x2019;s birds were bigger, and they picked on him and made him miserable. My father liked to let them fly around the apartment, the whole flock of them, whirring through the air and pooping on things. When it was time to put them back in their cage, I had to catch them one by one, which wasn&#x2019;t easy.<br>What worried me was that he might bring home more parakeets or something worse. Sometimes he would talk about monkeys. I am looking for a monkey,&#x201d; he would tell me. I just missed getting one no bigger than this,&#x201d; he told me, showing me with his fingers how little it was. When I went back to the pet store, someone had bought it. But don&#x2019;t worry, Neddie. We will find a monkey.&#x201d; I did worry. I worried a lot. I worried thaat he would find not one monkey but twelve monkeys. Those were going to be hard to catch and they probably bit a lot harder than paraaaaakeets.<br> Don&#x2019;t you think it would be nice to have a dog?&#x201d; I asked my father. Just a regular dog?&#x201d; You should have seen this monkey,&#x201d; my father said. He was just like a tiny person.&#x201d; I think maybe there was already a plan to move to Los Angeles and everybody just forgot to tell me about it, or maybe not. My mother was used to my father, as I said, and when he announced we were moving across the country in a week, she just started getting things ready. Eloise seemed to be all right with the idea as far as I could tell. She is a lot older than I am, was in high school at the time, and didn&#x2019;t discuss things with me very much.<br>Or, maybe my father really had thought of it on the spur of the moment when I asked him about the eat-in-the-hat restaurant. My father is an eccentric. I didn&#x2019;t know that word at the time, but I knew he was one. He&#x2019;s not crazy or anything like that. He doesn&#x2019;t rave or flip his lips with a finger and go bibble, bibble. He just does things such as suddenly move his whole family to California, or travel in a deluxe double drawing room on the Super Chief with a bunch of parakeets.<br>The Second World War had ended a few years earlier, and my father came out of the war a rich man. He had gotten rich selling shoelaces to the army and the navy. Brown shoelaces to the army and black shoelaces to the navy. Before the war started he had gone to this auction. An auction is where they put things up for sale and people holler out how much they are willing to pay and the highest bid gets it.<br>He was at this auction, and one of the items was a large lot of shoelaces it turned out to be a boxcar full of them. He won the whole thing for fifty-seven dollars. It turned out that along with the shoelaces came a shoelace-making machine. All this machine does is put the little metal or plastic tips on the ends of the shoelaces the actual shoelace stuff comes in big rolls. You want fourteen-inch shoelaces, you put the little metal tip, which is called an aglet, every fourteen inches; you want a sixteen-inch shoelace, you put the aglet every sixteen inches. He got more machines and had a shoelace factory. After the war, my father invented plaid shoelaces, and shoelaces in colors like pink and bright blue. People bought millions of them.<br>And this is why my father was rich, and why we were on the deluxe Super Chief going to Los Angeles without a care in the world.<br>It was exciting to be on a train trip. My father had booked a double drawing room that&#x2019;s two of the largest compartments, with the wall between them folded open to make something like a tiny apartment, with two tiny bathrooms, armchairs that turn into beds, and long benchlike sofas that fold into beds at night, also beds that fold down out of the wall, and you climb a little ladder to get in. The walls and ceiling were made of steel, painted pale green, and the floor was carpeted. There was a little white button on the wall, and when you pressed it you&#x2019;d hear a bell go ding somewhere far away and a Pullman porter would come.<br>There are these guys, Pullman porters, black guys with deep voices, elegant manners, and starched white jackets. When you travel in a double drawing room, the porters give you extra-good service, because you are obviously somebody important or rich. Our porters were Mr. Frederick and Mr. Jefferson. They called my father Mr. Wentworthstein, which is our name, and brought us newspapers, playing cards, and ice-cold 7-Up, which I had never had before. My father said that 7-Up was the perfect beverage for train travel, and I agreed with him.<br>Looking out the window I saw other travelers hurrying to get on the Super Chief, redcaps who are guys with red caps rolling carts piled high with luggage, chefs in white coats and those tall chef&#x2019;s hats, loading boxes and boxes of things to cook into the dining car. There were conductors in blue suits with shiny brass buttons, the engineer in striped overalls, various railroad guys checking the wheels everyone hustling and bustling plus hot, steamy smells and powerful buzzing and hissing noises. The train itself was like a big living thing, like a dinosaur or a giant snake. You had to go up some steep steel steps to get into it. Once you were in it, it smelled . . . like a train I didn&#x2019;t have anything to compare it to it smelled of leather and clean carpeting, and hot motor oil, and rich people.<br>There was a lot of scurrying around and getting settled into the double drawing room. Mr. Frederick and Mr. Jefferson made sure all our suitcases were on board; the conductor, in his blue suit, came by and punched our tickets with a shiny silver ticket puncher. We looked out the window again. The rush of people on the platform was thinning out, getting slower. There were clunks and thumps as the steel stairs were folded up, and the doors banged shut. Some of the people outside the train were friends and relatives of people who were taking the trip. They waved and made faces at their friends who were on board. Guys in blue railroad suits wrote things down on clipboards and looked at pocket watches.<br> All aboard!&#x201d; somebody hollered. The people on the platform took a step back from the train. More bumps, thumps, and bangs. A guy in a railroad uniform, looking annoyed, walked fast alongside the train, up toward the engine. Then he walked back the other way. Everybody on the platform was standing still, facing the train.<br>Then we felt a bump, then a bump the other way. Nobody said anything. Another bump. The people on the platform were sliding to the left. Poles and columns and baggage carts too. We were moving! I could feel the wheels rumble under us. Slowly, slowly, the train was moving out of the station!<br> Let&#x2019;s let the birds out of the boxes,&#x201d; my father said. They need a little exercise.&#x201d; My father was busy setting up his Zenith portable radio, a big thing, almost like a little suitcase, covered in black bumpy leather. It had the patented Wave Magnet, which was an oval plastic object the size of two dessert plates, with suction cups this you&#x2019;d stick to the window, and there was a flat ribbonlike cable that connected it to the radio. My father had bought it specially for the trip, and we were going to hear all the usual radio programs while we crossed the country in style.<br>My mother was leafing through a magazine, and Eloise was reading a book about art history. From Eloise&#x2019;s expression, and what I knew about her personal tastes, I was pretty sure she was pretending she was traveling with some other family one with no parakeets or little brothers or maybe alone.<br>As the train came out of the darkness of the station and into the semidarkness of the railyards on a gloomy winter afternoon, with the parakeets whirring and whizzing around the double drawing room and my family sipping 7-Up, I felt a kind of excitement I had never felt before. I knew I had begun my first big adventure.<br>Up to now, all my adventures had been either small or completely imaginary.<br></p><h2>The Love of God: An Intimate Look at the Father-Heart of God (OSWALD CHAMBERS LIBRARY)</h2><p><p>Chambers&#x2019; study assumes the absolute authority of the Bible, then searches it deeply to discover treasures that enhance spiritual growth.

If he hadn't been such a prodigiously gifted actor, O'Toole could have made it as a writer. His prose is discursive, freewheeling, multilayered, and fairly bursting with exuberant vitality. <b>Loitering with Intent: The Apprentice</b> covers O'Toole's years in the early 1950s at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where he studied his craft, hobnobbed with fellow students (including Albert Finney, with whom he formed a lifelong friendship), and made rakish, footloose excursions around London. It's hard to say whether he had more fun in the living of it or the retelling, but both are a pleasure for the reader to behold.Really elided first volume of O'Toole's autobiography. Those hot for chat about the star's great films (Lawrence of Arabia, etc.) and the great actors and drinkers with whom he has worked and busted up the world must wait for the next installment. Born in 1932 in (perhaps) Ireland (a fact counterfacted by there being an English as well as an Irish birth record), and raised as a native of the now vanished (he says) town of Hunsbeck in Yorkshire, O'Toole writes in a lingual ecstasy whose charms will enfroth many and will often have readers untangling congested diction, including baby talk much like Joyce's in his portrait of the artist as a young moo-cow and a striving for hip underclass lyricism of a richness much like Dylan Thomas's brush-work on the fey folk of Under Milk Wood (O'Toole played Captain Cat in the film version). One must go with O'Toole and his inner merriment; at times, he strikes off an engaging passage for which his mannered voice fits the action. Less happily, O'Toole sandbags us with a halfpenny life of Adolf Hitler as seen through the eyes of Childe Peter--a third of the book! All right, Hitler loomed large, but O'Toole's Adolf is both a boy's reaction to newsreel Nazis (``Childhood meant war, barbed wire...'') and a skim from standard Hitler bios. Better moments include his tour in the Royal Navy (``My sea had been black; black and grey with great lumps of roaring white water crashing over our bows to rush swilling along the lurching deck. Often I had stood, gloved hands gripping a rail or a stanchion, just gazing, awed by this immense world of black and brutal water''), and his rather pastel auditions for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. Too, his sporting dad's life as a bookie, thumbed onto the page with large gobs of paint, looms big in his limericky dashabout high jinks. High lumpen. Wordsman, be spare.

This Newbery Medal-winning book and children&#39;s literature classic is perfect for fans of Laura Ingalls Wilder&#39;s Little House on the Prairie books, historical fiction, and timeless stories using rich and beautiful language. Sarah, Plain and Tall gently explores themes of abandonment, loss, and love. The 30th Anniversary edition includes author Patricia MacLachlan&#39;s Newbery speech, a discussion guide, and a reading list. Set in the late nineteenth century and told from young Anna&#39;s point of view, Sarah, Plain and Tall tells the story of how Sarah Elisabeth Wheaton comes from Maine to the prairie to answer Papa&#39;s advertisement for a wife and mother. Before Sarah arrives, Anna and her younger brother, Caleb, wait and wonder. Will Sarah be nice? Will she sing? Will she stay? Correlates to the Common Core State Standards in English Language Arts</p><p>MacLachlan, author of Unclaimed Treasures, has written an affecting tale for children. In the late 19th century a widowed midwestern farmer with two children--Anna and Caleb--advertises for a wife. When Sarah arrives she is homesick for Maine, especially for the ocean which she misses greatly. The children fear that she will not stay, and when she goes off to town alone, young Caleb--whose mother died during childbirth--is stricken with the fear that she has gone for good. But she returns with colored pencils to illustrate for them the beauty of Maine, and to explain that, though she misses her home, &#34;the truth of it is I would miss you more.&#34; The tale gently explores themes of abandonment, loss and love.<p>"Did Mama sing every day?"Caleb asks his sister Anna."Every-single-day," she answers."Papa sang, too."</p><p>Their mother died the day after Caleb was born. Their house on the prairie is quiet now, and Papa doesn't sing anymore. Then Papa puts an ad in the paper, asking for a wife, and he receives a letter from one Sarah Elisabeth Wheaton, of Maine. Papa, Anna, and Caleb write back. Caleb asks if she sings.</p><p>Sarah decides to come for a month. She writes Papa: I will come by train. I will wear a yellow bonnet. I am plain and tall, and Tell them I sing. Anna and Caleb wait and wonder. Will Sarah be nice? Will she like them? Will she stay?</p></p><h2>Jerusalem (Royal Court)</h2><p><p>"[A] startlingly brilliant new play. . . . A tragic and hilarious vision of life in an English country community.

Not knowing anyone, she decided to take her six-month old daughter to the Dallas Quilt Show. Three days later, she was hooked. After discovering that hand piecing wasn't her thing, Paula visited a notions counter and purchased the tools she would need to cut out and piece her quilt tops. Once she completed her fourth top, she was asked to teach a class at a local quilt store. Her husband encouraged her to give it a shot and the rest, as they say, is history. Paula taught in the Dallas/Fort Worth area for more than 25 years, and now teaches at shops and quilt guilds throughout the US.</p><br><br><p>Paula Barnes and Mary Ellen Robison met more than 15 years ago when they both moved to the same street in Katy, Texas.

The year 1975 saw a resurgence in quilting due to the upcoming Bicentennial Celebration, so Mary Ellen made her first quilt, a baby quilt that defied almost all of the rules of quiltmaking. Fortunately, shortly after that initial attempt, Mary Ellen took her first quilt class and the spell was cast. Being a wife, mother of three, full-time school librarian, and seamstress for her three children took most of her time, but her love of quilting and fabric was always present. Relocating to Texas, meeting Paula, and discovering reproduction fabrics reignited Mary Ellen's enduring passion for quilts.</p></p><h2>Silk Road</h2><p>1260 AD: Josseran Sarrazini is a Templar Knight, trained for war. But as the Christian garrisons in the Holy Land begin to fall to the Saracen, he must embark upon a mission of peace: to the golden palaces at Xanadu, to seek an alliance with Kubilai Khan, ruler of the greatest empire in history and commander of the invincible Mongol horde. Josseran's task is formidable. To ride the treacherous Silk Road to the edge of the known world. To cheat hunger, thirst, and death. And to forge a crucial allegiance with a people who do not honor his cause, or his God. Blazing with adventure, epic in scope, and utterly compulsive, <i>Silk Road </i>weaves a spellbinding story of war, honor, and desire onto the vast tapestry of the medieval East.</p><p>First, a confession. I got something wrong.<br>&nbsp;<br>In my defence, I spent a year of my life and travelled fivethousand miles doing the research for SILK ROAD and the book <i>is</i> a hundred and fifty thousand wordslong. <br>&nbsp;<br>But yes, on page 164, I made a mistake.<br>&nbsp;<br>I found out when a reader sent me this email: <br>&nbsp;<br>"I started reading Silk Road a couple of days back and wasenjoying it very much, just as I had enjoyed one of your other books. <br>&nbsp;<br>However, when I reached Page 164 I found these words:"...green fields planted with tomatoes and aubergines..." I don't know aboutaubergines but I do know, <i>as do mostpeople,</i> [my italics] that tomatoes were not introduced to European cuisine,let alone further east, until the 16th century ...<br>&nbsp;<br>Until I saw these words I had been impressed by the breadthand quality of your research but this is such a basic mistake that I just don'tfeel I can read on - it's not possible to enjoy an historical novel once onerealizes that the facts can't be trusted. I thought I'd point this out so thatthe mistake can be amended in future printings."<br>&nbsp;<br>So there you have it. The case for the prosecution rests. <br>&nbsp;<br>I have admitted my guilt and have taken to my bare back withchains. I leave on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela within the week.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don't know how this one got through. I spent a yearresearching SILK ROAD, paying close attention - among many other subjects - toTatar politics and dynastic succession after the death of Chinggis Khan, theNestorian church, shamanism among the nomadic tribes of the steppes, Crusaderpolitics, the topography of Shang-tu, (a city that long ago ceased to exist) ...shall I go on? The list is endless. None of it was easy.<br>&nbsp;<br>But yes, I do very occasionally make mistakes.<br>&nbsp;<br>I call for the defence Ken Follett, whose eleven hundredpage epic The Pillars of the Earth has rightfully been lauded as a masterpiece forits exhaustive historical research also contains ... hush my mouth ... errors. <br>&nbsp;<br>For example, the many encounters across social classesdepicted in the book are unlikely - as the nobility spoke Norman French and thelower classes didn't. Sugar - which is mentioned several times - was notavailable in England then. A priory storeroom contained hops - but hops werenot used for food production until centuries later.<br>&nbsp;<br>(But as far as I can ascertain he was spot on about tomatoes- 1-0 to Ken there.)<br>&nbsp;<br>What galls me most is that researching SILK ROAD nearly costme my life. <br>&nbsp;<br>Seriously. <br>&nbsp;<br>Reaching the Mogao caves near Dunhuang, for example, meantrenting a Chinese four wheel drive and a driver and taking a day's drive intothe mountains north of the Taklimakan in far western China.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just as we got back to Dunhuang the steering rod broke andthe car slewed off the road. Five minutes earlier we were driving along anescarpment; the slewing would not have been into a ditch but off a hair pinbend and down a five hundred metre cliff .<br>&nbsp;<br>Perhaps our fall would have been cushioned by that tomatofield I saw at the bottom.<br>&nbsp;<br>That research trip was some of the most uncomfortable travellingI've done in my life. I'll tell you about it some time; the projectilevomiting, the three puppies and the two men sharing the sleeper bed above mine,all those forty eight hour bus journeys ... I think I might have mentioned some of these things on my web page.<br>&nbsp;<br>I didn't list that as part of my bibliography or my sources.I love a bit of adventure. But I naively expect the trouble I go to will earnme just a little bit of leeway with vegetables. <br>&nbsp;<br>Sorry - fruit.<br>&nbsp;<br>The mistake has been amended in all online versions, I'mpleased to say. And I hope it wouldn't stop you reading it anyway, it's one ofmy favourite books.

W. Sughrue becomes increasingly baffled as the case&#39;s suspects begin dying violently. By the author of The Last Good Kiss.</p><p>"This is not my kind of job, man," Montana private eye C.W. Sughrue insists when his psychiatrist pal, Dr. William "Mac" MacKinderick, asks him to find out who surreptitiously duplicated minidisks containing his conversations with seven long-term analysis patients. But, as we soon discover in James Crumley's <i>The Right Madness</i>, this is <i>precisely</i> the sort of investigation toward which C.W. (for Chauncey Wayne) gravitates--filled with violence, sex, despair, and victims at a dime a dozen, not to mention enough booze and illegal drugs to floor a full-grown rhino.<p> Life hasn't treated Sughrue kindly over the years. Introduced in <i>The Last Good Kiss</i> (1978), this now late-middle-aged, Texas-born redneck and Vietnam vet was left for dead at the end of the Hammett Award-winning <i>The Mexican Tree Duck</i> (1993), and he almost bit it on several more occasions in the revenge fantasy <i>Bordersnakes</i> (1996). As <i>Madness</i> opens, C.W.'s younger lawyer wife, Whitney, has taken new employment in Minneapolis, and he's in serious denial about the consequences of this separation on their marriage. Instead, Sughrue loses himself in MacKinderick's supposedly "easy job"--witnessing a series of gruesome deaths (including the botched hanging of a professor's spouse and an artist's fatal tumble), chasing across the highway-striped West in search of some missing forensic evidence, being physically violated by a "blond giantess from Ukraine," and endeavoring to protect his client's redheaded wife from a couple of licentious FBI agents and her own self-destructive habits. Along the way, MacKinderick's blood-soaked sports car is found on a Washington state Indian reservation, and the doctor is presumed dead. But that only drives Sughrue on harder, as he tries, with help from seductive Butte attorney Claudia Lucchesi, to determine how all the pieces of this puzzle fit together. He's barely more successful at that task than readers will be. But then, Crumley's detective stories have always been stronger on character development, high-caliber action, literary wit, and lyrical exposition than on meticulous plot construction. If you've ever wondered how Hunter S. Thompson might have rewritten Raymond Chandler's <i>The Long Goodbye</i>, <i>The Right Madness</i> provides more than a few clues. Watch out: bad craziness ahead. <i>--J. Kingston Pierce</i></p>James Crumley is the author of eleven novels, including one of the most critically acclaimed detective novels, <i>The Last Good Kiss.

While most people deny emotional lows in the hopes that they will go away; eat, drink, or tranquilize themselves; take mood elevators; or otherwise fill their time with empty activities, Keen instead teaches us how to re-vision negative emotions as positive way stations on the path to self-discovery.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Inward Bound</i>, Keen shows us how to recover the full spectrum of our feelings and points the reader on a journey to greater health, intimacy, vitality, and a renewed joy in life.</p><p><b>Sam Keen</b> is a noted author and lecturer who has written thirteen books on philosophy and religion. He earned graduate degrees from the Harvard Divinity School and Princeton University, and spent twenty years working as an editor of&nbsp;<i>Psychology Today</i>. Keen coproduced the Emmy-nominated PBS documentary&nbsp;<i>Faces of the Enemy</i>, and was the subject of a PBS special with Bill Moyers entitled&nbsp;<i>Your Mythic Journey with Sam Keen</i>. When not writing or traveling around the world lecturing and giving seminars on a wide range of topics, Keen cuts wood, tends to his farm in the hills above Sonoma, takes long hikes, and practices the flying trapeze.Here, rescued from out-of-print limbo in an apparent attempt to capitalize on the success of Keen's bestselling A Fire in the Belly, comes a 1980 Keen work, slightly revised and given a new introduction--and a new name, so much more 90's-style than the original: What to Do When You're Bored and Blue. Well, as we pointed out 12 years ago, one thing you should not do is to read this book, which is, as we said then, full of ``bubble-headed mystical insights'' in which Keen ``takes boredom as a synonym for practically every lifestyle malady, from simply monotony to full- fledged depression,'' and recommends, among other tactics, that you ``replace the TV set with your own imagination: `On my channel 1 this morning, Sophia Loren and I are shipwrecked....' Flotsam.'' -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Revised and updated with significant new material, including new revelations about atrocities perpetrated against civilians by both sides in this epic conflict, this &#34;definitive work on the subject&#34; (Richard Bernstein, &#34;The New York Times) has been given a fresh face forty years after its initial publication in 1961. In brilliant, moving detail, Thomas analyzes a devastating conflict in which the hopes, dreams, and dogmas of a century exploded onto the battlefield. Like no other account, The Spanish Civil War dramatically reassembles the events that led a European nation, in a continent on the brink of world war, to divide against itself, bringing into play the machinations of Franco and Hitler, the bloodshed of Guernica, and the deeply inspiring heroics of those who rallied to the side of democracy. Communists, anarchists, monarchists, fascists, socialists, democrats -- the various forces of the Spanish Civil War composed a fabric of the twentieth century itself, and Thomas masterfully weaves the diffuse and fascinating threads of the war together in a manner that has established the book as a genuine classic of modern history."Mr. Thomas has understood [the Spanish Civil War] incredibly well and has written it superbly.

"The camera will never be invented that could capture or encompass all that he actually sees," Truman Capote once said of Cecil Beaton. Though known for his portraits, Beaton was as incisive a writer as he was a photographer. First published in 1954, The Glass of Fashion is a classic&#x2014;an invaluable primer on the history and highlights of fashion from a man who was a chronicler of taste, and an intimate compendium of the people who inspired his legendary eye. Across eighteen chapters, complemented by more than 150 of his own line drawings, Beaton writes with great wit about the influence of luminaries such as Chanel, Balenciaga, and Dior, as well as relatively unknown muses like his Aunt Jessie, who gave him his first glimpse of "the grown-up world of fashion." Out of print for decades but recognized and sought after as a touchstone text, The Glass of Fashion will be irresistible to a new generation of fashion enthusiasts and a seminal book in any Beaton library. It is both a treasury and a treasure.</p><p>Sir Cecil Beaton (1904&#x2013;1980) was a photographer in the 1920s for Vanity Fair and Vogue. As a portraitist, he photographed the stars of fashion, society, and the art worlds, and was considered the unofficial court photographer of the British royal family. He was also an Oscar-winning stage and costume designer. Hugo Vickers is Beaton&#x2019;s official biographer and literary executor. He has lectured about him all over the world and assisted with the many exhibitions devoted to Beaton.<p>"So excited to read "the bible of fashion."" -<i>Champagne and Heels</i><br><br> &#x201c;...this exquisitely reproduced reissue of his 1954 tome, subtitled&nbsp;<i>A Personal History of Changing Tastes and the People Who Have Inspired Them,</i>&nbsp;is a collection of the designer&#x2019;s photos and commentary.

Frank Schooner, one of the giants of the Golden Age of American Illustration, was renowned for his scenes of life on the western frontier of America and Canada. Schoonover captured the flavor of the west and northwest in his dramatic outdoor compositions which depicted cowboys, Indians, trappers, Eskimos - the people and way of life that he knew, loved, and painted first hand. His keen sense of observations, coupled with his vivid documentary style, made his illustrations powerful paintings in themselves. They are now exhibited and collected for their own sake, independent of the books they illustrated, as unforgettable documents of a legendary way of life. Like the other great painter/illustrators of the Brandywine School -he was a student of Howard Pyle and a contemporary of such notables as N. C. Wyeth and Harvey Dunn - Schoonover was passionate about the portrayal of the American past. Although he lived most of his life in the Brandywine River area of Pennsylvania and Delaware, his commitment to the frontier dominated his work. A natural love for adventure and a yearning to find his own style sent him initially to the Canadian northwest, where he took naturally to the challenge of frontier life. Living among the Indians, canoeing, traveling by dogsled, and fending for himself brought authentic flavor to his paintings which illustrated many popular books and stories of adventure - most of which are now forgotten, although the paintings endure. This handsome collection is the first full-scale illustrated study of Schoonover&#39;s work, not only rediscovering the paintings of a major artist, but providing an important visual document of frontier life. 208 pages. 10 1/2 X 11 1/4. 48 color plates. 150 black-and-white illustrations.

There was no other place on earth like the U.P.-Michigan's Upper Peninsula. With Keweenaw Peninsula to the north and Ottawa National Forest to the south, there could be no more beautiful spot in the world. The cold, crystal-clear waters of the northernmost Great Lakes stretched to the horizon as far as she could see.<br> <br> But she'd never find those kids by focusing on the seascape. Pressing her foot to the accelerator, she left the lake behind as she urged her old Jeep Cherokee forward along the rutted dirt track. Bree's best friend, Naomi Heinonen, steadied herself against the door's armrest and looked over her shoulder at the two dogs still safely confined in their kennels. The Kitchigami Wilderness Preserve lay to the east, past Miser, a drive of only fifteen miles or so, but on this washboard road, it took longer than Bree liked.<br> <br> "Don't kill us getting there," Naomi shouted above the road noise.<br> <br> Bree didn't reply. These lost children weren't some vacationers without ties; they were residents of Rock Harbor, two of their own. And night would be here soon. If Naomi were driving, her foot would be heavy on the accelerator too. The preserve was a formidable tract that could swallow up two kids without a trace.<br> <br> The wind churned autumn's red and gold leaves in eddies and blew them across the road like brightly colored tumbleweeds. Equally colorful trees crowded the hills like giant banks of mums. The U.P. in autumn was Bree's favorite time, except when ever-shorter days put strangleholds on their search efforts. <br> <br> M-18 headed on east, but Bree made a sharp turn onto Pakkala Road, which would take them into a heavily forested area. In the spring, motor homes and SUVs pulling campers plied the road on their way to experience some of the last wilderness left in the Midwest. Today the road was practically empty.<br> <br> "Fill me in on what we know," Bree said.<br> <br> "Donovan O'Reilly reported Emily and Timmy missing three hours ago. They were on some outdoor nature thing with their school," Naomi said.<br> <br> Bree knew Donovan O'Reilly-he owned the local Ace Hardware store. His wife had left him and the kids nearly two years ago, and now his eyes had a haunted look, as though he wondered what fate would hand him next. Bree often stopped by Ace to pick up supplies for the ongoing renovation of her lighthouse home, and a friendship of sorts had developed between them. <br> <br> "One of the students said she heard Emily talk about seeing a raccoon," Naomi continued, "so that might be what caused the kids to wander off. It's not much to go on, but they've started searching." She chewed on her lip. "You remember Timmy has diabetes? I wonder when his shot is due."<br> <br> "I was thinking about that." Bree imagined Donovan was out of his mind with worry. "Donovan asked me out last week; did I tell you that?" she asked. She'd been tempted to tell him yes. Her lighthouse echoed with silence, but she had realized it wasn't fair to use someone like Donovan to ward off her loneliness. "I said no, of course."<br> <br> Naomi didn't reply, and Bree looked at her curiously. "What? You don't like him? Didn't he used to be your brother's best friend? You probably know him and the kids pretty well."<br> <br> A flush moved to Naomi's cheeks, and she looked out the window. "That was a long time ago. I only see him at the hardware store now, and I like him fine. Why did you say no?"<br> <br> "I'm not ready. Maybe I never will be." Bree tapped the steering wheel with impatient fingers, wishing the Jeep could go faster over the bumpy, rutted road. Instead, she slowed and turned onto the access road that would take her back to the campground parking lot. <br> <br> As she pulled in, Bree saw people fanning out in a search grid. There was an assortment of searchers, ranging from teenagers like Tommy Lempinen to professional types like Inetta Harris, who was still dressed in her business suit. When one of their own was threatened, Rock Harbor residents pulled together.<br> <br> Bree and Naomi got out, attached leashes to the dogs, and shrugged their arms into their ready-kit backpacks, fully outfitted with first-aid kit, small plastic tarp, energy bars, flashlight, flares, bug repellant, towelettes, compass, Swiss pocketknife, radio, topographic map of the area, canteen, sunglasses, sunscreen, and every other item one was likely to need on a search. A young woman in a brown National Park Service uniform was Bree's first target.<br> <br> "We're the Kitchigami K-9 Search and Rescue team," Bree told her, though that much was printed on the bright orange vests that both the women and the dogs wore. "I'm Bree Nicholls. Who's in charge?"<br> <br> The young woman pointed toward a group of people nearly hidden by a stand of sycamore. "The lead ranger is over there." Bree looked and recognized Donovan's ink-dark hair among them.<br> <br> Bree and Naomi headed toward the group. Donovan saw Bree and broke away. Pain contorted his handsome features. With his black hair and dark blue eyes, Bree had always thought he looked a bit like Pierce Brosnan, though today he was too upset and pale to carry off the James Bond sang-froid. <br> <br> "Please, you've got to find the kids!" His hands trembled as he thrust two small jackets toward her. "They don't even have their jackets on, and it's supposed to get to near freezing tonight." The torment in his eyes spoke of his fear of loss more clearly than his words. "Timmy's shot is overdue now."<br> <br> His voice quavered, and Bree put a comforting hand on his arm. She knew the anxiety he felt. "We'll find them, Donovan. The dogs are well trained, and Samson has a special radar for children."<br> <br> His head snapped up as if mounted on a spring. A dawning hope filled his face. "I'll come with you."<br> <br> How well Bree remembered that overwhelming desire to help. The waiting was the hard part. When her husband's plane went down, taking their son and all her hopes for their future with it, she had felt a crushing need to do something. In her case, there had been nothing to do but try to move on. With any luck, Donovan probably would not be in that situation. <br> <br> She shook her head as she took the jackets from his hand. "You have to stay close to base, Donovan. The kids will be scared when we find them, and you'll need to be in a position to get to them quickly when they're found. Try to stay calm. We still have several hours before sunset. We'll find them." <br> <br> Donovan nodded, but his gaze flickered from Bree to Naomi with a naked appeal in his eyes. "I want to do something."<br> <br> "Pray," Naomi advised. <br> <br> His eyes squeezed shut. "I started that as soon as I learned they were gone," he whispered.<br> <br> Naomi's answer to everything was prayer. Prayer had done little for Bree's own desperate pleas. What use was a God like that? <br> <br> "Let's go," Bree said.<br> <br> As they approached the tree line, a slim, feminine figure stepped out of a stand of jack pine and came toward them. Bree lifted a hand in greeting. She should have known her sister-in-law wouldn't be far from the action. She craved media attention the way the mine owners craved cheap workers. <br> <br> Hilary Kaleva pushed aside the branches barring her way into the clearing as though they were a personal affront. Hilary, Rock Harbor's mayor, was having the mother of all bad-hair days. Her hair, blond like her brother Rob's, was swept up in a formerly elegant French roll, but strands loosened by tree branches now clung damply to her neck. Streaks of mud marred her navy suit, and bits of pine needles clung to the fabric.<br> <br> "It's the poodle," Naomi muttered to Bree. "I'm out of here. I'll wait with the rangers."<br> <br> "Coward," Bree murmured. She wished she could laugh. Rob used to call Hilary his "poodle sister," which Hilary found less than amusing, but Bree and Naomi had always thought the description apt. Hilary could be sweet and loving one moment then turn and bite without provocation. And she talked until Bree grew weary of listening. But she could be just as endearing as a poodle when she wanted to be. From the expression on her face, today wasn't one of those days.<br> <br> Samson woofed at Hilary in greeting and strained at the leash to meet her. The mayor flinched at the sniffing dog, pulling away with a moue of distaste. As if sensing Hilary's animosity, Samson lurched toward Hilary then came alongside Bree and rubbed his nose against her knee. Bree tugged him farther away from her sister-in-law. No sense in upsetting her. <br> <br> Hilary's scowl eased when Bree pulled the dog a safe distance away. "What are you doing here? I thought you were searching the northeast quadrant today."<br> <br> Bree's smile faltered. Hilary always managed to drain her confidence with a relentless determination to bend her to her will. "I was home when the call came in. The brick is crumbling on the tower, and it seemed like a good day to repoint it. I was just about to mix the mortar when Mason called." Bree stopped and chided herself for babbling like a kid caught playing hooky. Maybe it was time they both realized Rob's plane might never be found. Not in the northeast quadrant or any other. The forest had swallowed the Bonanza Beechcraft like Superior could swallow a sinking ship.<br> <br> Hilary's eyes flashed. "You have more important things to do than to repoint the brick on your lighthouse. Let a professional do it."<br> <br> "The last time I checked, my bank balance was screaming for mercy, Hilary."<br> <br> Hilary sighed, and she gave a smile that seemed forced. "I'll pay for it. You promised you'd find them, Bree. It's been nearly a year. Rob's birthday is the day after Thanksgiving. I'm counting on giving him a decent buria...</p></p><h2>The World of M.C.

I was light-headed with hunger, for the child-assessors said I must not eat on the day of the test. I had been up since dawn; the washing and dressing and making up were a long and tiring business. My parents bathed my feet in the bidet. We had never seen such a thing before and thatseemed the natural use for it. None of us had ever stayed in a hotel. We thought it most grand, though I see now that it was a budget tourist chain. I remember the smell of onions cooking in <i>ghee</i> as I came down in the elevator. It smelled like the best food in the world.I know the men must have been priests but I cannot remember if they wore formal dress. My mother cried in the lobby; my father's mouth was pulled in and he held his eyes wide, in that way that grown-ups do when they want to cry but cannot let tears be seen. There were two other girls for the test staying in the same hotel. I did not know them; they were from other villages where the <i>devi</i> could live. Their parents wept unashamedly. I could not understand it; their daughters might be goddesses.On the street, rickshaw drivers and pedestrians hooted and waved at us with our red robes and third eyes on our foreheads. The <i>devi</i>, the <i>devi</i> look! Best of all fortune! The other girls held on tight to the men's hands. I lifted my skirts and stepped into the car with the darkened windows.They took us to the Hanumandhoka. Police and machines kept the people out of the Durbar Square. I remember staring long at the machines, with their legs like steel chickens' and naked blades in their hands. The King's Own fighting machines. Then I saw the temple and its great roofs sweeping up and up and up into the red sunset and I thought for one instant the upturned eaves were bleeding.The room was long and dim and stuffily warm. Low evening light shone in dusty rays through cracks and slits in the carved wood; so bright it almost burned. Outside you could hear the traffic and the bustle of tourists. The walls seemed thin but at the same time kilometers thick. Durbar Square was a world away. The room smelled of brassy metal. I did not recognize it then but I know it now as the smell of blood. Beneath the blood was another smell, of time piled thick as dust. One of the two women who would be my guardians if I passed the test told me the temple was five hundred years old. She was a short, round woman with a face that always seemed to be smiling, but when you looked closely you saw it was not. She made us sit on the floor on red cushions while the men brought the rest of the girls. Some of them were crying already. When there were ten of us the two women left and the door was closed. We sat for a long time in the heat of the long room. Some of the girls fidgeted and chattered but I gave all my attention to the wall carvings and soon I was lost. It has always been easy for me to lose myself; in Shakya I could disappear for hours in the movement of clouds across the mountain, in the ripple of the grey river far below, and the flap of the prayer banner in the wind. My parents saw it as a sign of my inborn divinity, one of the thirty-two that mark those girls in whom the goddess may dwell.In the failing light I read the story of Jayaprakash Malla playing dice with the <i>devi</i> Taleju Bhawani who came to him in the shape of a red snake and left with the vow that she would only return to the Kings of Kathmandu as a virgin girl of low caste, to spite their haughtiness. I could not read its end in the darkness, but I did not need to. I was its end, or one of the other nine low-caste girls in the god-house of the <i>devi</i>.Then the doors burst open wide and firecrackers exploded and through the rattle and smoke red demons leaped into the hall. Behind them men in crimson beat pans and clappers and bells. At once two of the girls began to cry and the two womencame and took them away. But I knew the monsters were just silly men. In masks. These were not even close to demons. I have seen demons, after the rain clouds when the light comes low down the valley and all the mountains leap up as one. Stone demons, kilometers high. I have heard their voices, and their breath does not smell like onions. The silly men danced close to me, shaking their red manes and red tongues, but I could see their eyes behind the painted holes and they were afraid of me.Then the door banged open again with another crash of fireworks and more men came through the smoke. They carried baskets draped with red sheets. They set them in front of us and whipped away the coverings. Buffalo heads, so freshly struck off the blood was bright and glossy. Eyes rolled up, lolling tongues still warm, noses still wet. And the flies, swarming around the severed neck. A man pushed a basket towards me on my cushion as if it were a dish of holy food. The crashing and beating outside rose to a roar, so loud and metallic it hurt. The girl from my own Shakya village started to wail; the cry spread to another and then another, then a fourth. The other woman, the tall pinched one with a skin like an old purse, came in to take them out, carefully lifting her gown so as not to trail it in the blood. The dancers whirled around like flames and the kneeling man lifted the buffalo head from the basket. He held it up in my face, eye to eye, but all I thought was that it must weigh a lot; his muscles stood out like vines, his arm shook. The flies looked like black jewels. Then there was a clap from outside and the men set down the heads and covered them up with their cloths and they left with the silly demon men whirling and leaping around them.There was one other girl left on her cushion now. I did not know her. She was of a Vajryana family from Niwar down the valley. We sat a long time, wanting to talk but not knowing if silence was part of the trial. Then the door opened a third time and two men led a white goat into the <i>devi</i> hall. They brought it right between me and the Niwari girl. I saw its wicked, slotted eye roll. One held the goat's tether, the other took a big ceremonial <i>kukri</i> from a leather sheath. He blessed it and with one fast strong stroke sent the goat's head leaping from its body.I almost laughed, for the goat looked so funny, its body not knowing where its head was, the head looking around for the body and then the body realizing that it had no head and going down with a kick, and why was the Niwari girl screaming, couldn't she see how funny it was, or was she screaming because I saw the joke and she was jealous of that? Whatever her reason, smiling woman and weathered woman came and took her very gently away and the two men went down on their knees in the spreading blood and kissed the wooden floor. They lifted away the two parts of the goat. I wished they hadn't done that. I would have liked someone with me in the big wooden hall. But I was on my own in the heat and the dark and then, over the traffic, I heard the deep-voiced bells of Kathmandu start to swing and ring. For the last time the doors opened and there were the women, in the light."Why have you left me all alone?" I cried. "What have I done wrong?""How could you do anything wrong, goddess?" said the old, wrinkled woman who, with her colleague, would become my mother and father and teacher and sister. "Now come along with us and hurry. The King is waiting."Smiling Kumarima and Tall Kumarima (as I would now have to think of them)took a hand each and led me, skipping, from the great looming Hanuman temple. A road of white silk had been laid from the foot of the temple steps to a wooden palace close by. The people had been let into the square and they pressed on either side of the processional way, held back by the police and the King's robots. The machines held burning torches in their grasping hands. Fire glinted from their killing blades. There was great silence in the dark square."Your home, goddess," said Smiling Kumarima, bending low to whi...</p><h2>The New Science of Strong Materials: Or Why You Don&#39;t Fall Through the Floor</h2><p>Why isn&#39;t wood weaker that it is? Why isn&#39;t steel stronger? Why does glass sometimes shatter and sometimes bend like spring? Why do ships break in half? What is a liquid and is treacle one? All these are questions about the nature of materials. All of them are vital to engineers but also fascinating as scientific problems. During the 250 years up to the 1920s and 1930s they had been answered largely by seeing how materials behaved in practice. But materials continued to do things that they &#39;ought&#39; not to have done. Only in the last 40 years have these questions begun to be answered by a new approach. Material scientists have started to look more deeply into the make-up of materials. They have found many surprises; above all, perhaps, that how a material behaves depends on how perfectly - or imperfectly - its atoms are arranged. Using both SI and imperial units, Professor Gordon&#39;s account of material science is a demonstration of the sometimes curious and entertaining ways in which scientists isolate and solve problems.</p><p><p>"I found Gordon's writing style fascinating; his book reads like a novel, and the technical content is superb."<b>--Enoch J. Durbin, Princeton University</b></p>James Edward Gordon was born in 1913. He took a degree in naval architecture at Glasgow University and worked in wood and steel shipyards, intending to design sailing ships. On the outbreak of the Second World War he moved to the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, where he worked on wooden aircraft, plastics and unorthodox materials of all kinds. He designed the sailing rescue dinghies carried at one time by most bomber aircraft. He later became head of the plastic structures sections at Farnborough and developed a method of construction in reinforced plastics which is now used for a number of purpose in aircraft and rockets. For several frustrating years he worked in industry on the strength of glass and the growth of strong &#39;whisker&#39; crystals. In 1962 he returned to government service as superintendent of an experimental branch at Waltham Abbey concerned with research and development of entirely new structural materials, most of which were based on &#39;whiskers&#39;. He was Industrial Fellow Commoner at Churchill College, Cambridge, and became Professor of Materials Technology at the University of Reading, where he was later Professor Emeritus. He was awarded the British Silver Medal of the Royal Aeronautical Society for work on aircraft plastics and also the Griffith Medal of the Materials Science Club for contributions to material science. His book, Structures or Why Things Don&#39;t Fall Down, is also published in Penguin. Professor Gordon died in 1998.

Carefully, if impulsively (and also illegally), he tapped into the main irrigation channel.<p>And so began -- though few knew it at the time -- the Milagro beanfield war. But like everything else in the dirt-poor town of Milagro, it would be a patchwork war, fought more by tactical retreats than by battlefield victories. Gradually, ever so awkwardly, the small farmers and sheepmen begin to rally to Joe's beanfield as the symbol of their lost rights and their lost lands. The tale of Milagro's rising is wildly comic and lovingly tender, a vivid portrayal of a town that, half-stumbling and partly prodded, groped its way toward its own stubborn salvation.</p><p><b>John Nichols</b>'s <i>New Mexico Trilogy</i>, inaugurated in 1974 with the publication of <i>The Milagro Beanfield War</i>, has grown from regional stature to national appeal, from literary radicals to cult classics.

Her detailed examinations of nature combined scientific curiosity with the eloquent creative expression of a true artist. Imogen Cunningham: Flora presents a stunning selection of Cunningham&#39;s botanical images dating from 1913 through the 1970s, with an emphasis on work from the 1920s and 1930s. More than half the images have never been published. In his illustrated essay, author Richard Lorenz discusses Cunningham&#39;s abiding amateur interest in botany and traces the evolution of her photographic imagery, which closely paralleled many of the technical and aesthetic developments of the twentieth century. Botanical notes on plants illustrated in the plates, a chronology of Cunningham&#39;s life, and a selected bibliography are included.</p><p>Richard Lorenz is a member of the Imogen Cunningham Trust and is currently the curator of Frontiers, a long-running Arts America exhibition in Europe.

Creeping back onto the streets were Britain&#x2019;s homegrown fascists, directed from the shadows by Sir Oswald Mosley. Horrified that the authorities refused to act, forty-three Jewish exservicemen and women resolved to take matters into their own hands. In 1946, they founded the 43 Group and let it be known that they were willing to stop the far-right resurgence by any means necessary.<br><br> Their numbers quickly swelled. Joining the battlehardened ex-servicemen in smashing up fascist meetings were younger Jews, including hairdresser Vidal Sassoon, and gentiles as well, some of whom volunteered to infiltrate fascist organisations. The Group published its own newspaper, conducted covert operations, and was able to muster a powerful force of hundreds of fighters who quickly turned fascist street meetings into mass brawls. The struggle peaked in the summer of 1947 with the Battle of Ridley Road, where thousands descended on the Hackney market to participate in weekly riots.<br><br> The history of the 43 Group is not just a gripping story of a forgotten moment in Britain&#x2019;s post-war history; it is also a timely lesson in how to confront fascism&#x2014;and how to win.</p><p><b>Daniel Sonabend</b> is a writer and historian who lives in London.

It&#x2019;s a little-known story as it tends to get hidden behind the pre-war appearance of Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists but, as we read here, Mosley wasn&#x2019;t finished with his Jew-baiting.

First serial, Sports Afield.</p><p>Introduced to hunting at the age of seven, the author continues to pursue the sport. He owns an 800-acre farm in northern Florida, where he raises his favorite game bird, bobwhite quail. Here he reflects on a way of life that reconciles hunting with preservation of land and wildlife. Valdene offers an interesting glimpse of wildlife management-building a favorable habitat for quail by planting trees and shrubs, dividing fields, building dams and employing controlled burning. He writes about his dogs and other animals attracted to the farm. He takes us through the bobwhite's year, from nesting to maturity to the pot (with recipes). Valdene, whose works have appeared in Field and Stream and Sports Afield, has written a gem that will appeal not only to hunters but to all readers who love the land.

It will include novels, poetry, short stories, essays, travel-writing and other non-fiction. The series will be extensive and open-ended and will provide school students with a range of edited texts taken from a wide geographical spread.Embittered by a false accusation, disappointed in friendship and love, the weaver Silas Marner retreats into a long twilight life alone with his loom. . . and his gold. Silas hoards a treasure that kills his spirit until fate steals it from him and replaces it with a golden-haired founding child. Where she came from, who her parents were, and who really stole the gold are the secrets that permeate this moving tale of guilt and innocence. A moral allegory of the redemptive power of love, it is also a finely drawn picture of early nineteenth-century England in the days when spinning wheels hummed busily in the farmhouses, and of a simple way of life that was soon to disappear.<p></p><p>"I think <i>Silas Marner</i> holds a higher place than any of the author's works.

There are more than five hundred million copies of her books in print, published in over thirty-four countries.<br>She was a woman with a mission. Her move from West Virginia to New York had a series of purposes, outlined carefully in her mind. She would find the perfect place to live, become a success in her chosen field, and get her man. <br><br>Preferably, but not necessarily, in that order. <br><br>Frederica Kimball was, she liked to think, a flexible woman. <br><br>As she walked down the sidewalk on the East Side in the early-spring twilight, she thought of home. The house in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, with her parents and siblings, was, to Freddie's mind, the perfect place to live. Rambling, noisy, full of music and voices. <br><br>She doubted that she could have left it if she hadn't known she would always be welcomed back with open arms. <br><br>It was true that she had been to New York many times, and had ties there, as well, but she already missed the familiar&#x2014; her own room, tucked into the second story of the old stone house, the love and companionship of her siblings, her father's music, her mother's laugh. <br><br>But she wasn't a child any longer. She was twenty-four, and long past the age to begin to make her own. <br><br>In any case, she reminded herself, she was very much at home in Manhattan. After all, she'd spent the first few years of her life there. And much of her life in the years after had included visits&#x2014;but all with family, she acknowledged. <br><br>Well, this time, she thought, straightening her shoulders, she was on her own. And she had a job to do. The first order of business would be to convince a certain Nicholas LeBeck that he needed a partner. <br><br>The success and reputation he'd accumulated as a composer over the past few years would only increase with her beside him as his lyricist. Already, just by closing her eyes and projecting, she could envision the LeBeck-Kimball name in lights on the Great White Way. She had only to let her imagination bloom to have the music they would write flow like a river through her head. <br><br>Now all she had to do, she thought with a wry smile, was convince Nick to see and hear the same thing. <br><br>She could, if necessary, use family loyalty to persuade him. They were, in a roundabout way, semicousins. <br><br>Kissing cousins, she thought now, while her eyes lighted with a smile. That was her final and most vital mission. Before she was done, Nick would fall as desperately in love with her as she was, had always been, with him. <br><br>She'd waited ten years for him, and that, to Freddie's mind, was quite long enough. <br><br>It's past time, Nick, she decided, tugging on the hem of her royal blue blazer, to face your fate. <br><br>Still, nerves warred with confidence as she stood outside the door of Lower the Boom. The popular neighborhood bar belonged to Zack Muldoon, Nick's brother. Stepbrother, technically, but Freddie's family had always been more into affection than terminology. The fact that Zack had married Freddie's stepmother's sister made the Stanislaski-Muldoon-Kimball-LeBeck families one convoluted clan. <br><br>Freddie's longtime dream had been to forge another loop in that family chain, linking her and Nick. <br><br>She took a deep breath, tugged on her blazer again, ran her hands over the reddish-gold mop of curls she could never quite tame and wished once, hopelessly, that she had just a dash of the Stanislaskis' exotic good looks. Then she reached for the door. <br><br>She'd make do with what she had, and make damned sure it was enough. <br><br>The air in Lower the Boom carried the yeasty scent of beer, overlaid with the rich, spicy scent of marinara. Freddie decided that Rio, Zack's longtime cook, must have a pasta special going. On the juke, Dion was warning his fellow man about the fickle heart of Runaround Sue. <br><br>Everything was there, everything in place, the cozy paneled walls, the seafaring motif of brass bells and nautical gear, the long, scarred bar and the gleaming glassware. But no Nick. Still, she smiled as she walked to the bar and slid onto a padded stool. <br><br>"Buy me a drink, sailor?" <br><br>Distracted, Zack glanced up from drawing a draft. His easy smile widened instantly into a grin. "Freddie&#x2014;hey! I didn't think you were coming in until the end of the week." <br><br>"I like surprises."<br><br>"I like this kind." Expertly Zack slid the mug of beer down the bar so that it braked between the waiting hands of his patron. <br><br>Then he leaned over, caught Freddie's face in both of his big <br><br>hands and gave her a loud, smacking kiss. "Pretty as ever." <br><br>"You, too." <br><br>And he was, she thought. In the ten years since she'd met him, he'd only improved, like good whiskey, with age. The dark hair was still thick and curling, and the deep blue eyes were magnetic. And his face, she thought with a sigh. Tanned, tough, with laugh lines only enhancing its character and charm. <br><br>More than once in her life, Freddie had wondered how it was that she was surrounded by physically stunning people. "How's Rachel?" <br><br>"Her Honor is terrific." <br><br>Freddie's lips curved at the use of the title, and the affection behind it. Zack's wife&#x2014;her aunt&#x2014;was now a criminal court judge. "We're all so proud of her. Did you see the trick gavel Mama sent her? The one that makes this crashing-glass sound when you bop something with it?" <br><br>"Seen it?" His grin was quick and crooked. "She bops me with it regularly. It's something, having a judge in the family." His eyes twinkled. "And she looks fabulous in those black robes." <br><br>"I bet. How about the kids?" <br><br>"The terrible trio? They're great. Want a soda?" <br><br>Amused, Freddie tilted her head. "What, are you going to card me, Zack? I'm twenty-four, remember?" <br><br>Rubbing his chin, he studied her. The small build and china-doll skin would probably always be deceiving. If he hadn't known her age, as well as the age of his own children, he would have asked for ID. <br><br>"I just can't take it in. Little Freddie, all grown up." <br><br>"Since I am&#x2014;" she crossed her legs and settled in "&#x2014;why don't you pour me a white wine?" <br><br>"Coming up." Long experience had him reaching behind him for the proper glass without looking. "How're your folks, the kids?" <br><br>"Everybody's good, and everyone sends their love." She took the glass Zack handed her and lifted it in a toast. "To family." Zack tapped a squat bottle of mineral water against her glass. "So what are your plans, honey?" <br><br>"Oh, I've got a few of them." She smiled into her wine before she sipped. And wondered what he would think if she mentioned that the biggest plan of her life was to woo his younger brother. "The first is to find an apartment." <br><br>"You know you can stay with us as long as you want." <br><br>"I know. Or with Grandma and Papa, or Mikhail and Sydney, or Alex and Bess." She smiled again. It was a comfort to know she was surrounded by people who loved her. But... "I really want a place of my own." She propped her elbow on the bar. "It's time, I think, for a little adventure." When he started to speak, she grinned and shook her head at him. "You're not going to lecture, are you, Uncle Zack? Not you, the boy who went to sea." <br><br>She had him there, he thought. He'd been a great deal younger than twenty-four when he shipped out for the first time. "Okay, no lecture. But I'm keeping my eye on you." <br><br>"I'm counting on it." Freddie sat back and rocked a little on the stool, then asked&#x2014;casually, she hoped&#x2014;"So, what's Nick up to? I thought I might run into him here." <br><br>"He's around. In the kitchen, I think, shoveling in some of Rio's pasta special." <br><br>She sniffed the air for effect. "Smells great. I think I'll just wander on back and say hi."<br><br>"Go ahead. And tell Nick we're waiting for him to play for his supper." <br><br>"I'll do that." <br><br>She carried her wine with her and firmly resisted the urge to fuss with her hair or tug on her jacket again. Her attitude toward her looks was one of resignation. "Cute" was the best she'd ever been able to do with her combination of small build and slight stature. Long ago she'd given up on the fantasy that she would blossom into anything that could be termed lush or glamorous. <br><br>Added to a petite figure was madly curling hair that was caught somewhere between gold and red, a dusting of freckles over a pert nose, wide gray eyes, and dimples. In her teenage years, she'd pined for sleek and sophisticated. Or wild and wanton. Curvy and cunning. Freddie liked to think that, with maturity, she'd accepted herself as she was. <br><br>But there were still moments when she mourned being a life-size Kewpie doll in a family of Renaissance sculptures. <br><br>Then again, she reminded herself, if she wanted Nick to take her seriously as a woman, she had to take herself seriously first. <br><br>With that in mind, she pushed open the kitchen door. And her heart jolted straight into her throat. <br><br>There was nothing she could do about it. It had been the same every time she saw him, from the first time she'd seen him to the last. Everything she'd ever wanted, everything she'd ever dreamed of, was sitting at the kitchen table, hunkered over a plate of fettuccine marinara. <br><br>Nicholas LeBeck, the bad boy her aunt Rachel had defended with passion and conviction in the courts. The troubled youth who had been guided away from the violence of street gangs and back alleys by love and care and the discipline of family. <br><br>He was a man now, but he still carried some of the rebellion and wildness of his youth. In his eyes, she thought, her pulse humming. Those wonderful stormy green eyes. He still wore his hair long, pulled back into a stubby ponytail of dark, bronzed blond. He had a poet's mouth, a boxer's chin, and the hands of an artist. <br><br>She'd spent many nights fantasizing about those long-fingered, wide-palmed hands. Once she got beyond the face, with its fascinating hint of cheekbones and its slightly crooked nose&#x2014;broken years ago by her own sharp line drive, which he'd tried unsuccessfully to field&#x2014;she could, with pleasure, move on. <br><br>He was built like a runner, long, rangy, and wore old gray jeans, white at the knees. His shirtsleeves were rolled up to the elbow and missing a button. <br><br>As he ate, he carried on a running commentary with the huge black cook, while Rio shook the grease out of a basket of French fries. <br><br>"I didn't say there was too much garlic. I said I like a lot of garlic." Nick forked in another bite as if to back up his statement. "Getting pretty damned temperamental in your old age, pal," Nick added, his voice slightly muffled by the generous amount of pasta he'd just swallowed. <br><br>Rio's mild, good-natured oath carried the music of the islands. "Don't tell me about old, skinny boy&#x2014;I can still beat hell out of you." <br><br>"I'm shaking." Grinning, Nick broke off a hunk of garlic bread just as Freddie let the door swing shut behind her. His eyes lighted with pleasure as he dropped the bread again and pushed back from the table. "Hey, Rio, look who's here. How's it going, Fred?" <br><br>He crossed over to give her a casual, brotherly hug. Then his brows drew together as the body that pressed firmly against his reminded him, uncomfortably, that little Fred was a woman. <br><br>"Ah..." He backed off, still smiling, but his hands dipped cautiously into his pockets. "I thought you were coming in later in the week." <br><br>"I changed my mind." Her confidence lifted a full notch at his reaction. "Hi, Rio." Freddie set her wineglass aside so that she could properly return the bear hug she was enveloped in. <br><br>"Little doll. Sit down and eat." <br><br>"I think I will. I thought about your cooking, Rio, all the way up on the train." She sat, smiled and held out a hand to Nick. "Come sit down, your food's getting cold." <br><br>"Yeah." He took her hand, gave it a quick squeeze, then let it go as he settled beside her. "So, how is everybody? Brandon still kicking butt on the baseball diamond?" <br><br>"Batting .420, leading the high school league in home runs and RBIs." She let out a long sigh as Rio set a large plate in front of her. "Katie's last ballet recital was really lovely. Mama cried, of course, but then she tears up when Brand hits a four-bagger. You know, her toy store was just featured in the <i>Wash</i><i></i><i>ington Post. </i>And Dad's just finishing a new composition." She twirled pasta onto her fork. "So, how are things with you?" <br><br>"They're fine." <br><br>"Working on anything?" <br><br>"I've got another Broadway thing coming up." He shrugged. It was still hard for him to let people know when something mattered. <br><br>"You should have won the Tony for <i>Last Stop.</i>" <br><br>"Being nominated was cool." <br><br>She shook her head. It wasn't enough for him&#x2014;or for her. "It was a fabulous score, Nick. <i>Is </i>a fabulous score," she corrected, since the musical was still playing to full houses. "We're all so proud of you." <br><br>"Well. It's a living." <br><br>"Don't make his head bigger than it is," Rio warned from his stove. <br><br>"Hey, I caught you humming 'This Once,'" Nick noted with a grin. <br><br>Rio moved his massive shoulders in dismissal. "So, maybe one or two of the tunes weren't bad. Eat."<br><br>"Are you working with anyone yet?" Freddie asked. "On the new score?"<br><br>"No. It's just in the preliminary stages. I've hardly gotten started myself." <br><br>That was exactly what she'd wanted to hear. "I read somewhere that Michael Lorrey was committed to another project. You'll need a new lyricist." <br><br>"Yeah." Nick frowned as he scooped up more pasta. "It's too bad. I liked working with him. There are too many people out there who don't hear the music, just their own words." <br><br>"That would be a problem," Freddie agreed, clearing a path for herself. "You need someone with a solid music background, who hears words in the melody." <br><br>"Exactly." He picked up his beer and started to drink. <br><br>"What you need, Nick, is me," Freddie said firmly. <br><br>Nick swallowed hastily, set his beer down and looked at Freddie as though she had suddenly stopped speaking English. "Huh?" <br><br>"I've been studying music all my life." It was a struggle, but she kept the eagerness out of her voice and spoke matter-of-factly. "One of my first memories is of sitting on my father's lap, with his hands over mine on the piano keys. But, to his disappointment, composing isn't my first love. Words are. I could write your words, Nick, better than anyone else." Her eyes, gray and calm and smiling, met his. "Because I not only understand your music, I understand you. So what do you think?" <br><br>He shifted in his chair, blew out a breath. "I don't know what to think, Fred. This is kind of out of left field." <br><br>"I don't know why. You know I've written lyrics for some of Dad's compositions. And a few others besides." She broke off a piece of bread, chewed it thoughtfully. "It seems to me to be a very logical, comfortable solution all around. I'm looking for work, you're looking for a lyricist." <br><br>"Yeah." But it made him nervous, the idea of working with her. To be honest, he'd have had to admit that in the past few years, <i>she'd </i>begun to make him nervous. <br><br>"So you'll think about it." She smiled again, knowing, as the member of a large family, the strategic value of an apparent retreat. "And if you start to like th...</p><h2>The Refiner&#39;s Fire: Historical Highlights of Missouri</h2><p>To members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the state of Missouri is not only a place of tragic history, but also one with a glorious future.

But a few are able to survive and find a light in the aftermath, illuminating what we&#x2019;ve become.

Gass, yet imbued with Butler's own vision of the apocalyptic and bizarre.</p><p>Blake Butler&#x2019;s <i>Scorch Atlas</i> is precisely that a series of maps, or worlds, tied... so tight they couldn&#x2019;t crane their necks.&#x201d; Everything is either destroyed, rotting or festering -- and not only the physical objects, but allegiances, hopes, covenants. Yet these worlds are not abstract exercises, he is speaking of life as it is, where there might be or may be, glass over grave sites in display,&#x201d; and where we will be forced to make or where we have made facemasks out of old newspapers.&#x201d; The sole glimmer of light comes in recollection, as in: a bear the size of several men...

Amid the loosely woven threads that constitute his story, shards of crystal poetry strand the reader in wonderment. There&#x2019;s something so big about Blake&#x2019;s writing. Big as men&#x2019;s heads. Each inhale of Blake&#x2019;s wheeze brings streamers of loose hair, the faces of lakes and oceans, whales washed up half-rotten.

Open it! &#x2014;Ken Sparling<br><br>I am always looking for new writers like Blake Butler and rarely finding them, but <i>Scorch Atlas</i> is one of those truly original books that will make you remember where you were when you first read it. <i>Scorch Atlas</i> is relentless in its apocalyptic accumulation, the baroque language stunning in its brutality, and the result is a massive obliteration. &#x2014;Michael Kimball, author of <i>Dear Everybody</i><br></p><h2>Heavier Than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain</h2><p>It has been twenty years since Kurt Cobain died by his own hand in April 1994; it was an act of will that typified his short, angry, inspired life. Veteran music journalist Charles R. Cross fuses his intimate knowledge of the Seattle music scene with his deep compassion for his subject in this extraordinary story of artistic brilliance and the pain that extinguished it. Based on more than four hundred interviews; four years of research; exclusive access to Cobain's unpublished diaries, lyrics, and family photos; and a wealth of documentation, <em>Heavier Than Heaven</em> traces Cobain's life from his early days in a double-wide trailer outside of Aberdeen, Washington, to his rise to fame, success, and the adulation of a generation. Charles Cross has written a preface for this new edition, in which he recounts some of the events regarding Kurt Cobain and this book in the past two decades since his death.</p><p>The art of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain was all about his private life, but written in a code as obscure as T.S. Eliot's. Now Charles Cross has cracked the code in the definitive biography <i>Heavier Than Heaven</i>, an all-access pass to Cobain's heart and mind. It reveals many secrets, thanks to 400-plus interviews, and even quotes Cobain's diaries and suicide notes and reveals an unreleased Nirvana masterpiece. At last we know how he created, how lies helped him die, how his family and love life entwined his art--plus, what the heck "Smells Like Teen Spirit" really means. (It was graffiti by Bikini Kill's Kathleen Hanna after a double date with Dave Grohl, Cobain, and the "over-bored and self-assured" Tobi Vail, who wore Teen Spirit perfume; Hanna wrote it to taunt the emotionally clingy Cobain for wearing Vail's scent after sex--a violation of the no-strings-attached dating ethos of the Olympia, Washington, "outcast teen" underground. Cobain's stomach-churning passion for Vail erupted in six or so hit tunes like "Aneurysm" and "Drain You.") <p> Cross uncovers plenty of news, mostly grim and gripping. As a teen, Cobain said he had "suicide genes," and his clan was peculiarly defiant: one of his suicidal relatives stabbed his own belly in front of his family, then ripped apart the wound in the hospital. Cobain was contradictory: a sweet, popular teen athlete and sinister berserker, a kid who rescued injured pigeons and laughingly killed a cat, a talented yet astoundingly morbid visual artist. He grew up to be a millionaire who slept in cars (and stole one), a fiercely loyal man who ruthlessly screwed his oldest, best friends. In fact, his essence was contradictions barely contained. Cross, the coauthor of <i>Nevermind: Nirvana</i>, the definitive book about the making of the classic album, puts numerous Cobain-generated myths to rest. (Cobain never lived under a bridge--that Aberdeen bridge immortalized in the 12th song on <i>Nevermind</i> was a tidal slough, so nobody could sleep under it.) He gives the fullest account yet of what it was like to be, or love, Kurt Cobain. <i>Heavier Than Heaven</i> outshines the also indispensable <i>Come As You Are</i>. It's the deepest book about pop's darkest falling star. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><strong>Charles R.

He is the author of numerous New York Times bestsellers, including The Two Minute Rule, The Forgotten Man, and L.A. Requiem.With smooth efficiency, David Stuart reads this abridgment of Robert Crais's first novel, the Anthony and Macavity Award-winning mystery that introduced Private Investigator Elvis Cole. Stuart reads with a syncopated hesitation that confers a Hollywood sullenness but misses the "noir" edge of Crais's writing. Elvis Cole--the sensitive and wisecracking collector of Disneyana--and his heavy-artillery partner, Joe Pike, traipse through the seamier streets of Los Angeles, infiltrate high-society Hollywood, and cross the line with the Latino drug trade in search of an errant husband and a missing boy. The adventure and the characters of this novel are exciting and totally satisfying.

This newest book paints a kaleidoscopic portrait of a beloved confidant: the pit bull called Rosie.<br><br> In 1990, Myles chose Rosie from a litter on the street, and their connection instantly became central to the writer&#x2019;s life and work. During the course of their sixteen years together, Myles was madly devoted to the dog&#x2019;s wellbeing, especially in her final days. Starting from the emptiness following Rosie&#x2019;s death, <i>Afterglow (a dog memoir)</i> launches a heartfelt and fabulist investigation into the true nature of the bond between pet and pet-owner. Through this lens, we witness Myles&#x2019;s experiences with intimacy and spirituality, celebrity and politics, alcoholism and recovery, fathers and family history, as well as the fantastical myths we spin to get to the heart of grief.<br><br> Moving from an imaginary talk show where Rosie is interviewed by Myles&#x2019;s childhood puppet to a critical reenactment of the night Rosie mated with another pit bull, from lyrical transcriptions of their walks to Rosie&#x2019;s enlightened narration from the afterlife, <i>Afterglow (a dog memoir)</i> illuminates all that it can mean when we dedicate our existence to a dog.</p><p><b>Eileen Myles</b> is the author of more than twenty books, including <i>Afterglow (a dog memoir)</i>, <i>Inferno (a poet&#x2019;s novel)</i>, <i>Chelsea Girls</i>, and <i>Cool For You</i>.

When I&#x2019;m surrounded by trees, a condition I&#x2019;ve sought out pretty persistently throughout my life, the thing I think I might like the most about them is this whisper like all the hair of the world passing through the tunnel of one single breath&#x2015;if that is a form of percussion. This irregular hiss of trees and wind. I think it is my mother. And I am her son, and you are my dog.<br>Our relationship is part discomfort &amp; humiliation and part devotion. Oh once upon a time I wanted a dog exactly as much as I wanted to be alive. Maybe I didn&#x2019;t even want a dog then. I wanted to say that I was alive. Even to be a dog would be enough and how good if I could be seen wanting one and could begin asking for it incessantly&#x2015;if I could summon up asking in every possible manner. Please. Leaving notes under pillows and toilet seat covers. Did I want a dog, really. No I was a kid who was desperate to be seen in a state of desire &amp; supplication. That was many years ago. I wanted to already be my yes. A positive child in a state of knowing &amp; reaching out.

I was learning a Brahms sonata. After weeks it had started to come together into something I could feel good about. So good that I was up working on it at what is, for me, early morning: half-past eight, with a mug of powerful black coffee, and a big, bright, late fall morning beyond the windows.<br>I hate interruptions when I&#x2019;m at the piano; hate them so much, I used to turn the phone off. Now, though, I just ignore it if it rings. Except for this one number, the reason I leave it on. I leaned from the piano bench, grinning, and reached for the phone, which was still squeaking out those opening Valkyrie notes. In my world, Wagner only trumps Brahms when Wagner means Lydia Chin.<br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;<br>Silence, unlike Lydia; and an odd tone to it. Then she said, &#x201c;Nothing good.&#x201d;<br>Those two words contained darkness: anger, fear, and something else. Warning? My skin went cold. &#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d;<br>The answer didn&#x2019;t come from Lydia. It came from a different voice, relaxed and mocking in rhythm, but inhuman in tone: thin, robotic. Deliberately, electronically altered. &#x201c;It means, asshole, your girlfriend got jacked.&#x201d;<br>I was on my feet, heart pounding. &#x201c;What the&#x2014;Who are you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Come on, you don&#x2019;t know me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jesus Christ!

What do you want?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; In a flash, joviality gone, the metallic voice dropped. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s what you want. You want your girlfriend to live. Or am I wrong?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then find her. It&#x2019;s a game, get it? You find her, she lives. You don&#x2019;t, she dies.

That&#x2019;s all I know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jesus, look! The son of a bitch is in the game already! Instant offense, whoa, I like that. Okay, good, I&#x2019;ll go along. Here, sweetie. Talk to him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Bill?&#x201d; It was Lydia, which I&#x2019;d known, rock solid, from those first two words.<br>&#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So far. I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s going on, though.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Stay cool. I&#x2019;ll find you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know you will. But Bill? I don&#x2019;t want my mother to worry.

Tell him he&#x2019;ll have to get a little older without me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Aw.&#x201d; The robot voice sliced back in, dripping acid. &#x201c;How sweet is that? Doesn&#x2019;t want her mama to worry. Well, her mama&#x2019;s gonna have lots to worry about, you don&#x2019;t get your ass in gear.&#x201d;<br>I spun, stared wildly around the room, as though he might materialize and I could lunge for him. Forcing myself still, I said, &#x201c;I want to talk to her.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sorry, you just did. One to a customer.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;As this bullshit unfolds, what ever it is.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And by &#x2018;bullshit,&#x2019; you mean ... ?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;This insanity!

You know, maybe I don&#x2019;t want to play with you after all. Nah, on second thought, forget it. Of course, that means I pop your girlfriend. But I guess you don&#x2019;t care. So long, sucker.&#x201d;<br>The line went dead.<br>My heart had been speeding. Now it stopped. My breathing, my power to move, it all stopped. What the hell had I done?

So I know she&#x2019;s all right. You touch her, you motherfucker, I&#x2019;ll kill you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, oh, listen to him! Big man! Know what, I really should forget the game and kill her right now. What could you do about it? What, asshole? But I&#x2019;ll give you a chance. I&#x2019;ll play fair.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I talk to her. And you don&#x2019;t touch her.&#x201d; I dug in, praying my instincts were right. &#x201c;Or I don&#x2019;t play.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are you listening? Who&#x2019;s in charge here? You don&#x2019;t find her, she dies. And you know what? You don&#x2019;t play, I hurt her a lot and then she dies.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s your rules. My rules, as long as I&#x2019;m playing, you don&#x2019;t touch her, and I talk to her.&#x201d;<br>A hell of a gamble, going head-to-head with him like this. I didn&#x2019;t know who he was or what was going on. But if what he wanted was to kill Lydia he could have done that already, and he hadn&#x2019;t. This &#x201c;game&#x201d; mattered to him.<br>&#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; he finally said. &#x201c;Okay, why not? But my rules: not whenever you want. You don&#x2019;t get what you want in life, do you? Fuck knows I didn&#x2019;t. Which would be your fault, motherfucker, if you remember.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember. Tell me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No way! This is awesome! Oh, hey, did I mention you have twelve hours? A game&#x2019;s no fun without a clock. But we don&#x2019;t need no stinkin&#x2019; refs. Cops come, cops even think about coming, she&#x2019;s toast. I mean it, motherfucker. First badge I see, pow pow pow! You got the rules?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And I talk to her.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;When you do something right. Like a reward. Oh, I love that! Yeah, good. I&#x2019;ll call you. But if you&#x2019;re thinking she can coach, fuggedabahdit. She has no idea where she is. And her phone, now that we got your attention, it&#x2019;s trashed. I mean, you don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m that stupid?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know who you are, so maybe you are that stupid.&#x201d;<br>The slashing laugh again. &#x201c;Taunting! You could get called for that!&#x201d; Then the instant hard freeze. &#x201c;Okay, that&#x2019;s it. This is crap. Let&#x2019;s get down to it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What am I supposed do?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re so smart. Figure it out.&#x201d;<br>And he was gone.<br>I hit call back, but got Lydia&#x2019;s voicemail. I cut off and waited. He&#x2019;d have heard it ring; he&#x2019;d know I wanted to talk.

David Thompson shares his passion for the unique style of cooking that he believes to be one of the world&#39;s greatest cuisines. He provides over 300 mouthwatering recipes, from the simple, honest flavour of a classic pad thai or the refreshing tang of a Green Papaya Salad to such elaborate creations as Green Curry of Trout Dumplings with Apple Eggplants or Stir-fried Crispy Fish Cakes with Pork and Salted Eggs. A series of introductory chapters examine the role of food in Thai culture and society, offer guidance on ingredients, with notes on availability and subsitutions, and explain the essential techniques of Thai cookery. More than 50 menus provide ideas for combining Thai dishes. Beautifully written, and complimented by superb photography, this book captures all aspects of this diverse culinary culture.</p><p>"Thai cooking is a paradox," writes Australian restaurateur David Thompson in his comprehensive and thus aptly named <i>Thai Food</i>. "It uses robustly flavored ingredients--garlic, shrimp paste, chilies, lemongrass--and yet when they are melded during cooking they arrive at a sophisticated and often subtle elegance." Pursuing this transformation in depth, his book presents hundreds of recipes that celebrate the Thai meal while exploring its historical and cultural context. Readers will delight in the wide selection of authentic dishes like Duck and Spring Onion Soup, Grilled Beef Salad, and Green Chicken Curry with Baby Corn, and relish Thompson's vast appreciation of his subject. Though the recipes are straightforward and workable once ingredients are assembled and techniques understood, those new to Thai cooking may want a less rigorous introduction to the subject. However, anyone with an appetite to explore it on Thompson's terms will benefit immensely.<p> Beginning with an exploration of Thailand's history and culture, the book then presents an extended section on rice, the centerpiece of the Thai meal. The "cookbook" follows, with a systematic introduction to the Thai kitchen, ingredients, and equipment. The chapter "Food Outside the Meal" is devoted to Thai snacks and vendor food, such as Stir-Fried Crisp Fish with Holy Basil. Noodle dishes include an exemplary pad thai, and sweet dishes like Grilled Bananas with Coconut Cream and Turmeric are also offered. </p><p> Readers should know that the recipes, published primarily for an Australian audience, give ingredients in a mix of metric and American measurements and/or with nonmetric equivalents, and that nomenclature is also sometimes foreign ("minced" for "ground" meat, for example). With photos throughout, the book sets a standard for Thai cookbooks to come while helping many cooks achieve the true, richly exotic cuisine. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>David Thompson is one of Australia&#39;s leading chefs, restaurateurs and cookery writers. He is also an eloquent ambassador for Thai food and culture. His Sydney restaurants have increased the awareness and appreciation of authentic Thai cooking. In July 2001 he opened Nahm, in London&#39;s Halkin Hotel. Seven months later Nahm gained a Michelin star, making it the first Thai restaurant to attain such an award.</p><h2>The Hot Flash Club: A Novel</h2><p>From the bestselling author of <i>Between Husbands and Friends</i> and <i>An Act of Love</i> comes a wise, wonderful, and delightfully witty &#x201c;coming of age&#x201d; novel about four intrepid women who discover themselves as they were truly meant to be: passionate, alive, and ready to face the best years of their lives.<br><br>Meet Faye, Marilyn, Alice, and Shirley.

The year is 1936. Six-year-old Jean-Luc LaPointe, his little sister, and their spirited but vulnerable young mother have been abandoned&#x2014;again&#x2014;by his father, a charmer and a con artist. With no money and no family willing to take them in, the LaPointes manage to create a fragile nest at 238 North Pearl Street. For the next eight years, through the Great Depression and Second World War, they live in the heart of the Irish slum, with its ward heelers, unemployment, and grinding poverty. As Jean-Luc discovers, it&#x2019;s a neighborhood of &#x201c;crazyladies&#x201d;: Miss Cox, the feared and ridiculed teacher who ignites his imagination; Mrs. Kane, who runs a beauty parlor/fortune-telling salon in the back of her husband&#x2019;s grocery store; Mrs. Meehan, the desperate, harried matriarch of a thuggish family across the street; lonely Mrs. McGivney, who spends every day tending to her catatonic husband, a veteran of the Great War; and Jean-Luc&#x2019;s own unconventional, vivacious mother.<br><br>Jean-Luc is a voracious reader who never stops dreaming of a way out of the slum. He gradually takes on responsibility for the family&#x2019;s survival with a mix of bravery and resentment while his mom turns from spells of illness and depression to eager planning for the day when &#x201c;our ship will come in.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a heartfelt and unforgettable look back at one child&#x2019;s life in the 1930s and &#x2019;40s, a story that will be remembered long after the last page is turned.<br>Look for these Trevanian classics from Three Rivers Press: <i>Shibumi, The Eiger Sanction, The Loo Sanction, The Summer of Katya</i>, and <i>The Main</i>.</p><p>Trevanian lives in the French Basque region.

Beside the stoop was a stack of twine-bound cardboard boxes bulging with bedding, clothing and kitchen things. Around them were clustered our few scraps of furniture looking scuffed and shabby in the unforgiving glare of daylight. It was Saint Patrick's Day, and the mid-March sun felt good, but chill winter air still lurked in the shadows. The year was 1936; I was six years old, my sister was three, my mother was twenty-seven, and we were beginning a new life.<br><br>We had been sitting on that stoop long enough for the gritty brownstone to mottle the backs of my legs between my short pants and my knee-high stockings. My sister wore a starched, frilly dress that Mother had bought out of money meant to tide us over until we got on our feet because she wanted Anne-Marie to look pretty the first time her father saw her, but the dress had got crushed during the long drive with the three of us crammed into half of the front seat of my uncle's rattletrap of a truck. And now we sat hip to hip on that step, Mother in the middle, my sister and I drawing comfort from contact with her, while she drew maternal strength and determination from contact with us. Anne-Marie was hungry and sleepy and close to tears. Taking her onto her lap, Mother looked anxiously up and down the street for my father whom she hadn't seen for four years, not since the morning he went out to look for work and didn't come back, leaving her with a toddler, a baby, and two dollars and some change in her purse.<br><br>She didn't hear from him again until a letter arrived just three days earlier saying how sorry he was for running away from the family he loved, the family he had worried about every single minute since he left. There was no excuse for behaving like that, he admitted, but he just couldn't stand being made to feel he wasn't man enough to support his own wife and children. He had been sure that her family would give us a hand once he was out of the picture. He knew that Mother's father considered him to be little better than a flashy hustler and a con man--exactly what he was, in fact. The letter said that he had found a job and an apartment in Albany. Not much of a job and not much of an apartment, but it would be a start, and he had something big in the works. That letter had come in the nick of time, because the owner of Lake George Village's only all-year restaurant had just told my mother that he wouldn't be needing her as a waitress when the tourist season began. Her frequent absences during that winter when she was sick with lung trouble had shown him that she was unreliable, and he had decided to replace her.<br><br>During the whole trip down to Albany, my uncle had grumbled about the time and money this was costing him, and when we didn't find my father waiting at the address he had given us, my uncle just unloaded our stuff in grumpy haste and left us there, saying that he had to make it back before nightfall because he didn't trust the headlights of his old truck. He was in such a hurry to get away that he drove off without shutting the passenger-side door, which flopped open. As he reached over to shut it he stepped on his brakes, causing the door to pinch his hand. He roared a curse as he furiously stomped on the gas to get the hell away from that goddamn hole of a goddamn slum, but the truck stalled and a car behind him sounded its irritated horn, so he shouted at the driver to go to hell and started up again, and he drove off pounding his good fist on the steering wheel, glad to see the end of his wife's goddamned freeloading cousin and her goddamned brats!<br><br>Mother and I exchanged glances and couldn't help smiling.<br><br>My father's letter had said that we should wait for him on the steps of the building because he was planning a big surprise for us, but now Mother was tired of sitting there with people peering at us from windows and stoops all around. She rose to go inside and look for him, but I grabbed her wrist. Like most kids, I loved surprises, and I didn't want her to ruin this one. Let's wait just a little while longer.<br><br>A couple of boys detached themselves from a knot of kids and sauntered past our stoop, disdainfully eyeing our cardboard boxes and our shoddy furniture, then letting their sassy eyes slide over me. I knew that my short pants and knee socks made me an object of scorn to these two boys dressed in knickers. From school I was familiar with those universal rituals among boys when they puppy-sniff one another for the first time, measuring and hefting for rank and dominance. I could tell that the smaller of the two boys, a big-eared kid about a year older than I, was wondering if this skinny new kid would turn out to be a regular guy or a sissy, if I would fight my way out of school-yard challenges or run to the teachers. I kept my eyes on him as he strolled by, but I held him in a soft, tired look. To look hard-eyed would be to send a challenge; to avoid his eyes would be to submit. Boys are born with this canine pack-hunter's instinct for caste and nipping order. After the kids had passed, one of them crossed the street and spoke to a flat-faced, boneless woman sitting on her stoop, obviously his mother, and I could see she was asking him about us, especially about my mother, who wasn't anything like the faded, marshmallow mothers of other kids. My mother was young and slim and had short bobbed hair; she could dance and run and play games, and she wore slacks in an era when few women did. I don't know what the kid said, but his mother sniffed in a way that was both competitive and dismissive. I was used to that sort of reaction to my mother, but still sensitive about it. It wasn't that I wanted her to be the same as other mothers. I was proud of her youthful good looks and her feisty independence, but I sometimes wished she could be different in a less obvious way because it's hard having a mother who's different.<br><br>Some bigger boys, fourteen or fifteen years old, loitered in front of a cornerstore diagonally across the street from our stoop. Fully aware of the gaggle of girls who admired them from two stoops away and whom they ostentatiously ignored, the boys talked loudly, pushed one another in gruff play, snorted out forced laughs and repeatedly glanced at their reflections in the cornerstore window with satisfaction, although now and then one of them felt obliged to hook a comb out from his back pocket and drag it through his Brylcreem'd hair, then press the sides into place with a caressing palm. They played an endless round-robin of that finger game in which paper covers rock, rock smashes scissors and scissors cut paper, known by different names in various parts of the country, but called 'Rochambeau' in the urban Northeast by generations of kids who had no idea that a French general who had helped our infant republic defeat the British at Yorktown had been immortalized in a child's game, much less how to spell the chanted sound as they threw their fingers out on the '-bow!' of the third syllable. The loser of Rochambeau had to let the winner 'knuckle' him, hit him on the top of the head as hard as he wanted to with the knuckle of his middle finger. The one who got knuckled would snort disdainfully although the pain sometimes dampened his eyes with fugitive tears, which he quickly blinked away as he rearranged his hair in the store window. Two of the boys were smoking, the biggest one, who was the leader, and a small ugly one who played the role of flunky and clown. They smoked like kids new to smoking do, trying to appear supremely casual, but fussily examining the burning ends of their cigarettes with grave frowns and tapping off the ash more frequently than it could gather. These older boys wore long trousers and were bare-headed, while the younger boys of the block were in knickerbockers and caps. Only very young boys wore short pants. Except for me, of course! The principal bane of my life was my mother's need to dress my sister and me better than other kids, in compensation, I suppose, for our lack of a father and a secure breadwinner. Because she couldn't afford new clothes, the hand-me-downs my sister and I wore were always cleaner and more freshly ironed than those of our playmates, yet another of those differences that kids will not endure.<br><br>The strange new sounds and gestures of life and play that I observed with a mixture of fascination and malaise from our stoop that first afternoon would, in the course of the eight and a half years I was to live on North Pearl Street, become the unremarkable and unremarked ambience of 'my block' with its noise, its squalor, its childhood rites and ordeals, the awkward rutting rituals of its adolescents, and its shoals of dirty brats with runny noses, nits and impetigo playing their screaming games of kick-the-can or stick ball, sassing icemen and pushcart vendors, blocking traffic and exchanging insults with truck drivers who wanted to get through.<br><br>On that first day, the game of stick ball in the middle of the street broke up when second base drove off. The preening boys in front of the cornerstore drifted away down Livingston Avenue toward the deserted warehouses between the freight yards and the river where, as I would learn by being one of them, they would snoop around the dripping, echoey, broken-glass-crunchy-under-foot, piss-smelling vastnesses of abandoned buildings, and they would chuck stones at the few window panes that remained tauntingly intact. North Pearl Street was a typical slum of the first half of what would be called the American Century. These slum blocks were identical in their essence and social effects, varying only in the cultural decoration of their ethnic concentrations. Pearl Street was Irish. More precisely, it was bog Irish.<br><br>Pearl Street was the sort of place that appeared, laundered and t...</p><h2>The Psychic Explorer</h2><p>With Vee Van Dam begins an epic trilogy on the subject of spiritual and cosmic exploration.

She had a legendary villa in Versailles, where in the late 1930s she held two fabulous parties&#x2014;her Circus Balls&#x2014;that marked the end of the social scene that her friend Cole Porter perfectly captured in his songs, as the clouds of war swept through Europe. Charlie Scheips tells the story of these glamorous parties using a wealth of previously unpublished photographs and introducing a large cast of aristocrats, beauties, politicians, fashion designers, movie stars, moguls, artists, caterers, florists, party planners, and decorators. A landmark work of social history and a poignant vision of a vanished world, Scheips&#x2019;s book belongs on the shelf with Abrams&#x2019; classics such as <i>Slim Aarons: Once Upon A Time</i> and <i>Tony Duquette. </i></p><p><b>Charlie Scheips</b> is a cultural historian who has curated exhibitions in the United States and Europe. He was the founding director of the Cond� Nast Archive in New York. He lives in New York City.&#x201c;Scheips utilizes 170 black-and-white and color images&#x2014;some previously unpublished&#x2014;to visually illuminate his fascinating narrative of this peerless woman&#x2019;s life, one that intersected with some of the most colorful and important characters of the day on both sides of the Atlantic, including Elsa Maxwell, William Randolph Hearst, Cecil Beaton, Janet Flanner, Gertrude Stein, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. The tome culminates with de Wolfe&#x2019;s final grand f�te, the second Circus Ball, which defined the glamour and decadence of international society before the lights went out all over Europe.&#x201d; (<i>Gotham magazine</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A treasure trove of close to two hundred unpublished photographs of Elsie de Wolfe&#x2019;s 1939 &#x2018;Circus Ball.&#x2019; [Scheips has] used these as the centerpiece of a book like no other, <i>Elsie de Wolfe&#x2019;s Paris: Frivolity Before the Storm.</i> On the surface, it&#x2019;s a voyeur&#x2019;s dream, a behind-the-scenes look at the high-water mark of a kind of entertaining that went extinct two months later, when Hitler invaded Poland. But more, it&#x2019;s a deep dive, an x-ray of an elite Society that took dinner parties and balls as seriously as we take our work&#x2014;because it was their work.&#x201d; (<i>Head Butler.com</i>)</p><h2>Folklore Genres</h2><p><p>The essays in Folklore Genres represent development in folklore genre studies, diverging into literary, ethnographic, and taxonomic questions. The study as a whole is concerned with the concept of genre and with the history of genre theory. A selective bibliography provides a guide to analytical and theoretical works on the topic.</p> <p>The literary-oriented articles conceive of folklore forms, not as the antecedents of literary genres, but as complex, symbolically rich expressions. The ethnographically oriented articles, as well as those dealing with classification problems, reveal dimensions of folklore that are often obscured from the student reading the folklore text alone. It has long been known that the written page is but a pale reproduction of the spoken word, that a tale hardly reflects the telling. The essays in this collection lead to an understanding of the forms of oral literature as multidimensional symbols of communication and to an understanding of folklore genres as systematically related conceptual categories in culture. What kinship terms are to social structure, genre terms are to folklore. Since genres constitute recognized modes of folklore speaking, their terminology and taxonomy can play a major role in the study of culture and society.</p> <p>The essays were originally published in Genre (1969&#x2013;1971); introduction, bibliography, and index have been added to this edition.</p></p><p>Dan Ben-Amos is Professor of Folklore and of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><h2>The New Jerusalem Bible</h2><p>Contains the complete text of the Regular Edition, with condensed notes and introductions.

If Youngling peoples found out that a supremely advanced and enlightened society like the Federation existed, it would irreparably damage their evolution. Stowing away aboard her father's ship, Elana suddenly becomes the key to a dangerous plan to turn back the invasion of Andrecia by an aggressive, space faring Youngling civilization. How can she possibly help the Andrecians who still believe in magic and superstition, against a force armed with advanced technology, without revealing her alien powers? Apprentice Medical Officer Jarel wishes that the planet the Imperial Exploration Corps have chosen to colonize didn't have a "humanoid" population already living on it. The invaders don't consider the Andrecians to be human and Jarel has seen the atrocious treatment the natives get from his people. How can he make a difference, when he alone regrets the destruction that is people bring? Georyn, the youngest son of a poor Andrecian woodcutter, knows only that there is a terrible dragon on the other side of the enchanted forest, and he is prepared to do whatever it takes to defeat it. In his mind, Elana is the Enchantress from the Stars who has come to test him, to prove he is worthy of defeating the dragon and its powerful minions. Despite both Elana's and Jarel's inner turmoil, Georyn's burden is by far the heaviest. Ultimately, he must pit his innocent faith in the magic of his Enchantress from the Stars against foes who have come from a world beyond his comprehension.</p></p><p>Be sure to read the FAQ page for this book at my website, where you'll also find my recent essay for adult readers, "Reflections on <i>Enchantress from the Stars</i>."

Carefully cut your bottle into teardrop-shaped petals that are each 2" to 3" long. You&#x2019;ll need about 20.</p> <br> <br> <p>2. Head outside with your craft materials and light your tea light. Then, using your needle-nose pliers, hold each petal over your tea light until it's warped into a curved rose petal shape. </p> <p><b>HINT:</b> You don't need to melt the petals or light them on fire.

Once you have 20 rose petals, hot glue them together by dotting a tiny bit of hot glue at the narrow end of each petal and layering them one on top of the next, forming a flower shape. Let the glue dry.</p> <br> <br> <p>4. If you feel you need more petals in the center for a fuller look, create and add petals as you see fit, then let dry. </p> <p><b>OPTIONAL:</b> If you're making a headband, set aside a couple of petals to use as leaves to cover up more of the band. </p> <p>5. Put a huge glob of hot glue on the base of your flower for good measure, and let dry.</p> <p>6. Spray paint the flower with Krylon Fusion spray paint for a plain rose, or with Krylon Glitter Blast if you want a sparkly blossom.

Producer of the Hendrix tribute CD, Stone Free, and the author of Hendrix: Setting the Record Straight (Warner, 1992), McDermott begins in 1963 with the session work Hendrix did for such performers as Curtis Knight and the Isley Brothers. He continues with Hendrix's classic, most popular work such as "Hey Joe" and "Purple Haze," progresses through the Band of Gypsies era, and ends in 1970 with the guitarist's untimely death. Though McDermott sheds little new light on the much-examined guitarist, his restraint in concentrating on Hendrix's musical development and lyrics is refreshing. McDermott offers a well-written, well-researched book with a selective discography and 100 photos that will serve well as a companion to his earlier book and Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeck's definitive Jimi Hendrix: Electric Gypsy (LJ 7/91).

It tells of eighteen-year-old Ahmad Ashmawy Mulloy and his devotion to Allah and the words of the Holy Qur&#x2019;an, as expounded to him by a local mosque&#x2019;s imam.<br><br>The son of an Irish-American mother and an Egyptian father who disappeared when he was three, Ahmad turned to Islam at the age of eleven. He feels his faith threatened by the materialistic, hedonistic society he sees around him in the slumping factory town of New Prospect, in northern New Jersey. Neither the world-weary, depressed guidance counselor at Central High School, Jack Levy, nor Ahmad&#x2019;s mischievously seductive black classmate, Joryleen Grant, succeeds in diverting the boy from what his religion calls the Straight Path. When he finds employment in a furniture store owned by a family of recently immigrated Lebanese, the threads of a plot gather around him, with reverberations that rouse the Department of Homeland Security. <br><br>But to quote the Qur&#x2019;an: <i>Of those who plot, God is the best.</i></p><p>John Updike was born in 1932, in Shillington, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Harvard College in 1954 and spent a year in Oxford, England, at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art. From 1955 to 1957 he was a member of the staff of <i>The New Yorker</i> and since 1957 has lived in Massachusetts. His novels have won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, the American Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Rosenthal Award, and the Howells Medal.I<i>Devils</i>, Ahmad thinks. <i>These devils seek to take away my God.</i> All day long, at Central High School, girls sway and sneer and expose their soft bodies and alluring hair. Their bare bellies, adorned with shining navel studs and low-down purple tattoos, ask, <i>What else is there to see?</i> Boys strut and saunter along and look dead-eyed, indicating with their edgy killer gestures and careless scornful laughs that this world is all there is&#x2014;a noisy varnished hall lined with metal lockers and having at its end a blank wall desecrated by graffiti and roller-painted over so often it feels to be coming closer by millimeters.The teachers, weak Christians and nonobservant Jews, make a show of teaching virtue and righteous self-restraint, but their shifty eyes and hollow voices betray their lack of belief. They are paid to say these things, by the city of New Prospect and the state of New Jersey. They lack true faith; they are not on the Straight Path; they are unclean. Ahmad and the two thousand other students can see them scuttling after school into their cars on the crackling, trash-speckled parking lot like pale crabs or dark ones restored to their shells, and they are men and women like any others, full of lust and fear and infatuation with things that can be bought. Infidels, they think safety lies in accumulation of the things of this world, and in the corrupting diversions of the television set. They are slaves to images, false ones of happiness and affluence. But even true images are sinful imitations of God, who can alone create. Relief at escaping their students unscathed for another day makes the teachers&#x2019; chatter of farewell in the halls and on the parking lot too loud, like the rising excitement of drunks. The teachers revel when they are away from the school. Some have the pink lids and bad breaths and puffy bodies of those who habitually drink too much. Some get divorces; some live with others unmarried. Their lives away from the school are disorderly and wanton and self-indulgent. They are paid to instill virtue and democratic values by the state government down in Trenton, and that Satanic government farther down, in Washington, but the values they believe in areGodless: biology and chemistry and physics. On the facts and formulas of these their false voices firmly rest, ringing out into the classroom. They say that all comes out of merciless blind atoms, which cause the cold weight of iron, the transparency of glass, the stillness of clay, the agitation of flesh. Electrons pour through copper threads and computer gates and the air itself when stirred to lightning by the interaction of water droplets. Only what we can measure and deduce from measurement is true. The rest is the passing dream that we call our selves.Ahmad is eighteen. This is early April; again green sneaks, seed by seed, into the drab city&#x2019;s earthy crevices. He looks down from his new height and thinks that to the insects unseen in the grass he would be, if they had a consciousness like his, God. In the year past he has grown three inches, to six feet&#x2014;more unseen materialist forces, working their will upon him. He will not grow any taller, he thinks, in this life or the next. <i>If there is a next,</i> an inner devil murmurs. What evidence beyond the Prophet&#x2019;s blazing and divinely inspired words proves that there is a next? Where would it be hidden? Who would forever stoke Hell&#x2019;s boilers? What infinite source of energy would maintain opulent Eden, feeding its dark-eyed houris, swelling its heavy-hanging fruits, renewing the streams and splashing fountains in which God, as described in the ninth sura of the Qur&#x2019;an, takes eternal good pleasure? What of the second law of thermodynamics?The deaths of insects and worms, their bodies so quickly absorbed by earth and weeds and road tar, devilishly strive to tell Ahmad that his own death will be just as small and final. Walking to school, he has noticed a sign, a spiral traced on the pavement in luminous ichor, angelic slime from the body of some low creature, a worm or snail of which only this trace remains. Where was the creature going, its path spiralling inward to no purpose? If it was seeking to remove itself from the hot sidewalk that was roasting it to death as the burning sun beat down, it failed and moved in fatal circles. But no little worm-body was left at the spiral&#x2019;s center.So where did that body fly to? Perhaps it was snatched up by God and taken straight to Heaven. Ahmad&#x2019;s teacher, Shaikh Rashid, the imam at the mosque upstairs at 27811?2 West Main Street, tells him that according to the sacred tradition of the <i>Hadith</i> such things happen:the Messenger, riding the winged white horse Buraq, was guided through the seven heavens by the angel Gabriel to a certain place, where he prayed with Jesus, Moses, and Abraham before returning to Earth, to become the last of the prophets, the ultimate one. His adventures that day are proved by the hoofprint, sharp and clear, that Buraq left on the Rock beneath the sacred Dome in the center of Al-Quds, called Jerusalem by the infidels and Zionists, whose torments in the furnaces of Jahannan are well described in the seventh and eleventh and fiftieth of the suras of the Book of Books.Shaikh Rashid recites with great beauty of pronunciation the one hundred fourth sura, concerning Hutama, the Crushing Fire:<i>And who shall teach thee what the Crushing Fire is?It is God&#x2019;s kindled fire,Which shall mount above the hearts of the damned;It shall verily rise over them like a vault,On outstretched columns.</i>When Ahmad seeks to extract from the images in the Qur&#x2019;an&#x2019;s Arabic&#x2014;the outstretched columns,<i> fi 'amadin mumaddada</i>, and the vault high above the hearts of those huddled in terror and straining to see into the towering mist of white heat, <i>naru l-lahi l-muqada</i>&#x2014;some hint of the Merciful&#x2019;s relenting at some point in time, and calling a halt to Hutama, the imam casts down his eyes, which are an unexpectedly pale gray, as milky and elusive as a kafir woman&#x2019;s, and says that these visionary descriptions by the Prophet are figurative. They are truly about the burning misery of separation from God and the scorching of our remorse for our sins against His commands. But Ahmad does not like Shaikh Rashid&#x2019;s voice when he says this. It reminds him of the unconvincing voices of his teachers at Central High. He hears Satan&#x2019;s undertone in it, a denying voice within an affirming voice. The Prophet meant physical fire when he preached unforgiving fire; Mohammed could not proclaim the fact of eternal fire too often.Shaikh Rashid is not much older than Ahmad&#x2014;perhaps ten years, perhaps twenty. He has few wrinkles in the white skin of his face. He is diffident though precise in his movements. In the years by which he is older, the world has weakened him. When the murmuring of the devils gnawing within him tinges the imam&#x2019;s voice, Ahmad feels in his own self a desire to rise up and crush him, as God roasted that poor worm at the center of the spiral. The student&#x2019;s faith exceeds the master&#x2019;s; it frightens Shaikh Rashid to be riding the winged white steed of Islam, its irresistible onrushing. He seeks to soften the Prophet&#x2019;s words, to make them blend with human reason, but they were not meant to blend: they invade our human softness like a sword. Allah is sublime beyond all particulars. There is no God but He, the Living, the Self-Subsistent; He is the light by which the sun looks black. He does not blend with our reason but makes our reason bow low, its forehead scraping the dust and bearing like Cain the mark of that dust. Mohammed was a mortal man but visited Paradise and consorted with the realities there. Our deeds and thoughts were written in the Prophet&#x2019;s consciousness in letters of gold, like the burning words of electrons that a computer creates of pixels as we tap the keyboard.The halls of the high school smell of perfume and bodily exhalations, of chewing gum and impure cafeteria food, and of cloth&#x2013;cotton and wool and the synthetic materials of running shoes, warmed by young flesh. Between classes there is a thunder of movement; the noise is stretched thin over a violence beneath, barely restrained. Sometimes in the lull at the end of the school day, when the triumphant, jeering racket of departure has subsided and only the students doing extracurricular activities remain in the great building, Joryleen Grant comes up to Ahmad at his locker. He does track in the spring; she sings in the girls&#x2019; glee club. As students go at Central High, they are &#x201c;good.&#x201d; His religion keeps him from drugs and vice, though it also holds him rather aloof from his classmates and the studies on the curriculum. She is short and round and talks well in class, pleasing the teacher. There is an endearing self-confidence in how compactly her cocoa-brown roundnesses fill her clothes, which today are patched and sequinned jeans, worn pale where she sits, and a ribbed magenta shorty top both lower and higher than it should be. Blue plastic barrettes pull her glistening hair back as straight as it will go; the plump edge of her right ear holds along its crimp a row of little silver rings. She sings in assembly programs, songs of Jesus or sexual longing, both topics abhorrent to Ahmad. Yet he is pleased that she notices him, coming up to him now and then like a tongue testing a sensitive tooth.&#x201c;Cheer up, Ahmad,&#x201d; she teases him. &#x201c;Things can&#x2019;t be so bad.&#x201d; She rolls her half-bare shoulder, lifting it as if to shrug, to show she is being playful.&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not bad,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sad,&#x201d; he tells her. His long body tingles under his clothes&#x2014;white shirt, narrow-legged black jeans&#x2014;from the shower after track practice.&#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking way serious,&#x201d; she tells him. &#x201c;You should learn to smile more.&#x201d;&#x201c;Why? Why should I, Joryleen?&#x201d;&#x201c;People will like you more.&#x201d;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care about that. I don&#x2019;t want to be liked.&#x201d;</p><h2>Best Karate: Gankaku, Jion, Vol. 8</h2><p>The three kata in this volume are on the Japan Karate Association recommended list and are notable for the sticklike use of the arms-Jitte, the circular movements of hands and feet coordinated with breathing-Hangetsu, and easy, agile movements, combined into continuous techniques-Empi.</p><p><br>MASATOSHI NAKAYAMA carries on the tradition of his teacher, Gichin Funakoshl, the Father of Modern Karate.

Many an intrepid restaurateur had been brought to ruin by the economic realities of trying to serve fresh Atlantic salmon, not to mention an edible tomato, 340 kilometres north of Toronto. But they kept trying, and this particular year at least three restaurants&#x2014;two steakhouses, as well as Bistro Champlain&#x2014;were vying for the attention of local gourmands.<br>&nbsp;<br>Of these, Bistro Champlain was by far the most successful. Partly this was the work of Jerry Wing, its creative chef, but being located across the highway from a first-class ski resort called the Highlands didn&#x2019;t hurt. When the Highlands did well, Bistro Champlain did well&#x2014;and right now it was doing very well indeed, owing to the winter fur auction. Buyers from all over the world had descended on Algonquin Bay to bid on hundreds of thousands of furs that would end up in showrooms from Manhattan to Moscow to Beijing. Champlain&#x2019;s dining room may have maintained its luxurious hush, but for a couple of hours the kitchen had been a scene of barely controlled chaos.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was nearly ten, and Sam Doucette had just plated what she hoped was the last order for the night: the maple venison, accompanied by sweet potato mash and a red wine reduction. The rush was over, and the decibel level of slamming skillets, pans and ramekins had finally settled below the pain threshold. Jerry had already gone home, and Sam was praying that Ken, the manager, would not seat some late arrival with a huge appetite. Working as a cook&#x2014;a skill her mother had taught her&#x2014;was supposed to be part-time, a way of subsidizing her art classes at Algonquin College, but for the past few nights she had been doing the work of two cooks, one of her colleagues having been summarily fired for attempting to exit the premises with two hams stuffed in his backpack. All but two of the waiters, Ali and Jeff, had gone home, and Sam couldn&#x2019;t wait to get out of there.<br>&nbsp;<br>She rested one foot on the bottom of an upturned pickle bucket and wiped the sweat from her brow with the sleeve of her chef &#x2019;s tunic. Would Randall call? If he called, fine. If not . . . well, she didn&#x2019;t want to think about that. Romance, she was discovering, was not uninterrupted bliss; mostly, it was uninterrupted anxiety. So she turned her mind to Loreena Moon, the heroine of a graphic novel she was drawing and writing just for fun. Well, she told herself it was just for fun&#x2014;she didn&#x2019;t want to get all worked up thinking about actually selling it&#x2014;but she was also toying with the idea that it might be a series. She had already drawn lots of images and written several scenes. For some reason, the imaginary Loreena Moon was clearer in Sam&#x2019;s mind than anything about her real life, except Randall and his passionate kisses.<br>&nbsp;<br>Loreena Moon was cool, aloof, self-reliant&#x2014;everything Sam was not. She moved through the shadows of the city, a perpetual frown of suspicion darkening her brow. She carried a knife in a fringed sheath on her hip, a quiver of arrows at her shoulder, and a small bow slung across her back. She was always outraged, always righting wrongs and saving helpless people, wronged people. Loreena never looked back and she was never, ever in love. She was the same age as Sam, eighteen, but she didn&#x2019;t live on the reserve and she didn&#x2019;t live in Algonquin Bay. Sam was not yet sure <i>where </i>Loreena Moon lived. It couldn&#x2019;t be a house or an apartment; no bills or personal responsibilities for Loreena. The only place Sam could imagine her staying was in hotel rooms, and never the same one twice.<br>&nbsp;<br>The kitchen clock hit ten, ending Champlain&#x2019;s food service for the night. Sam&#x2019;s cellphone rang in the breast pocket of her tunic and her heart gave a skip of happiness. The tiny screen said <i>Randall Wishart</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We have a place,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Please tell me we have a place. I&#x2019;ve missed you so much.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; Randall said. &#x201c;Come to the Island Road house. How long will you be?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m done here. I just have to set up for the lunch crew.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Park some ways away,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and don&#x2019;t let anybody see you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sam turned off the deep fryer, the ovens and ranges. She had already wiped down the counters and cutting boards. Ken McCoy, the manager, stuck his head in from the dining room and gave her the okay signal.<br>&nbsp;<br>She changed in a supply closet behind the kitchen. The white tunic came off and went into the laundry bin, followed by the ridiculous check pants. Loreena was always in black jeans and tank top, sometimes a black T-shirt, maybe with a cat logo or a lightning bolt. Sam&#x2019;s own jeans were a struggle, she was so sweaty from the stove. She pulled on the soft red sweater that she knew Randall liked, slung her coat over her arm and went out the back door to the parking lot.<br>&nbsp;<br>The night was fine, the snap and sparkle of December without the face-freezing cold that January would soon bring. Loreena Moon would have hopped on her Kawasaki, but Sam had to be careful getting into her &#x2019;96 Civic. The door had to be lifted just so as you opened it or the hinge would go out of whack and the thing would refuse to close.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Island Road property was out on Trout Lake, at the tip of a point it had all to itself. In summer there might have been people cruising by in boats, people driving back and forth to their cottages, but this time of yearit was dead quiet. Even so, Randall opened the door the way he always did, standing behind it so he couldn&#x2019;t be glimpsed by any chance passerby. He was still wearing one of the dark sports jackets he favoured for work, but he had taken his tie off and, seeing Sam, his face lit up like a hot young actor&#x2019;s at the Academy Awards. The moment Sam was inside, he took her in his arms and hugged her tight.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Three whole days,&#x201d; Sam said. &#x201c;I was going crazy.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Did anyone see you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you park?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The hydro turnoff you showed me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Cool.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The house was a bungalow, very open and lots of polished wood everywhere. Too pretty for Loreena, but Sam liked it just fine. She hoped the owners never came back. She took off her boots and hung up her coat in the vestibule and Randall hugged her again. He switched off the vestibule light and they went to the bedroom and got undressed, Sam draping her stuff on a wooden chair by the closet.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Jane have nice body,&#x201d; Randall said. &#x201c;Tarzan like.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I wish I could take a shower. I&#x2019;m all sweaty.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Me like all sweaty.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>They lay down on the blue blanket Randall always brought to cover whatever bed they happened to use. He kept it in his car and Sam occasionally wondered how he explained its presence there to his wife. He stretched out naked, hands behind his head, showing off his biceps. Sam loved his body. Loved it in a way she was sure you should never love anything of this world. She had always thought love would be a melding of minds, a union of souls, and until she slept with Randall Wishart she had never considered the possibility that you could be positively loony over the sheer physicality of another human being.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sam straddled Randall&#x2019;s chest, pinioning his arms. Her hands looked dark against his so not-Native skin. &#x201c;I think about you all the time,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Me too.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No, I mean really, really all the time.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;If I could draw like you, I&#x2019;d draw you over and over again, all day long.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sam touched his cheek. It was always smooth. Randall never allowed the slightest stubble. He would have considered it unprofessional in a realtor.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I think about your voice,&#x201d; she said, touching his neck. &#x201c;Sometimes I even hear it in my sleep.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh yeah? What am I saying?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you.&#x201d; She covered her face.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Come on, what am I saying?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sam shook her head.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I know what I say.&#x201d; He tilted her off and put his lips to her ear and whispered a string of outrageous commands and nipped at her earlobe. That started their usual delirious tangle, which after six months still had the power to leave Sam breathless and amazed. Randall always found just the right touch, the exact timing that could drive her pleasure up and over thresholds whose existence she hadn&#x2019;t even suspected. Was it just because he was older? Or did he have some kind of gift? Or was it&#x2014;maybe, oh, she hoped so&#x2014;because he really, totally, absolutely loved her? A Force Ten orgasm in no time at all.<br>&nbsp;<br>He fell away from her, gasping and laughing. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it. I swear. That was the one. I&#x2019;m never going to need another one. That was it for all time.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sam laughed. &#x201c;They ought to have an Olympic event. The hundred-metre orgasm.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Synchronized orgasms.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>They were laughing, but Sam was already beginning to feel sad the way she always did afterward. Sad that Randall would be going home to his wife. Sad that she would be going home to her mother and her little brother and her self-absorbed art instructors at Algonquin. Most of her friends had left town for universities farther afield. Her dad was off on one of his winter camping trips, hunting or just being alone, something he liked to be a lot. She turned on her side and touched Randall&#x2019;s pale shoulder. &#x201c;Can we go away somewhere, sometime, maybe?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;For a few days at least?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That would be nice, wouldn&#x2019;t it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Can we do it? Just take off for Toronto or Montreal or, I don&#x2019;t know, anywhere? For a weekend maybe? Even just overnight?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to, Sam, but I can&#x2019;t. What am I supposed to tell Laura?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Tell her that you&#x2019;ve found a beautiful Indian princess who makes you incredibly happy.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;d go over real well.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, make something up, then.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t, Sam. I&#x2019;m a terrible liar and Laura would know like that.&#x201d; He snapped his fingers.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sam could feel his tension rising the way it always did whenever she talked about life outside whatever vacant house they happened to be in. She knew she should shut up, but she couldn&#x2019;t stop. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you want to spend time with me somewhere else? Somewhere outdoors maybe? Or anywhere&#x2014;a coffee shop, a bookstore&#x2014;it doesn&#x2019;t even matter. Just somewhere we could be like normal people?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Sam, Laura and I have been together a long time. I can&#x2019;t just up and dump her, and like I say, I&#x2019;m a lousy liar.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s a good thing, I guess.&#x201d; Sam moved her hand to his forehead and stroked his eyebrows. He gave a little moan of pleasure, and soon he was asleep.<br>&nbsp;<br>He always fell asleep after, out cold like you&#x2019;d shot him full of Valium. He&#x2019;d stay that way for five or ten minutes, during which time Sam got to wonder about his other life, his real life. Laura Wishart was pretty and smart&#x2014;Sam had looked her up on the Internet&#x2014;the quintessential blond success, some kind of financial expert. She must have been well off to start with, because her father owned Carnwright Real Estate, where Randall worked. Sam wasn&#x2019;t sure why Randall was unhappy with his wife. He rarely talked about her, except to say they never had sex anymore.<br>&nbsp;<br>She tried to think about Loreena Moon. Loreena was free, always on the prowl. Loreena was cool and untouchable. She was like Pootkin, Sam&#x2019;s black cat that roamed the neighbourhood and sometimes came home and sometimes did not. She had given Loreena Pootkin&#x2019;s green eyes&#x2014;the only spot of colour in her monochrome artwork. She wasn&#x2019;t sure if you could actually have a single dot of colour like that in a real book, but she liked it.<br>&nbsp;<br>She wanted her heroine to be essentially good&#x2014;that is, always helping the underdog and bringing evildoers to justice. But she didn&#x2019;t want her to bebound by petty rules of behaviour. This past weekend she had drawn a series of images of Loreena swiping stuff. She was investigating a rich industrialist whom she suspected of poisoning the water supply of several reserves, and while snooping through one of his mansions she pocketed various valuable items. Sam liked the idea of Loreena being as amoral as Pootkin, but wasn&#x2019;t sure if she could square that with helping the underdog. She loved Pootkin, but not because the cat had shown any inclination to altruism.<br>&nbsp;<br>Randall woke up, and picked up his watch from the bedside table. &#x201c;God, I gotta go. I&#x2019;m supposed to be watching the game at Troy&#x2019;s place. I did see most of it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Better check the score before you get home.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll check it on my phone. Not that Laura cares.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>They got dressed and Randall folded up the blue blanket. In the vestibule they put on coats and boots. Randall switched off the light. His hushed voice in the dark as if people might be listening right outside the door. &#x201c;Give it two minutes, right?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And make sure the door is shut properly. Lock seems to be screwed up&#x2014;everything sticks in this house.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He gave her a quick kiss, said he couldn&#x2019;t wait until next time, and then he was gone. A cloud of cold air, smells of snow and pine. His car starting in the drive. It shouldn&#x2019;t hurt this much, she told herself. You&#x2019;re a big girl. Supposedly. No cat-hearted Loreena, though, that was obvious.<br>&nbsp;<br>She watched through the door window as his tail lights winked through the trees. It was a long drive back to town and then up the highway to the reserve; she decided she&#x2019;d better visit the bathroom before hitting the road. She wiped her boots on the mat until she was sure they wouldn&#x2019;t leave water on the hardwood.<br>&nbsp;<br>As she was coming out of the bathroom, she heard a key in the front door. A man&#x2019;s voice. Not Randall. Stomping of boots and voices answering.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sam stepped into the bedroom. If these are the owners, she said, or even another agent showing the place, I am in shit city, and so is Randall. But the owners weren&#x2019;t supposed to be back yet, and why would an agent be showing a house at this hour of the night? It didn&#x2019;t make sense. The toilet was still running, and she prayed it would stop.<br>&nbsp;<br>Voices and movement deeper into the house. Hall light going on.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sam got down on the floor and slid under the bed. There is no kind of serious person, she said, that would be in this situation.<br>&nbsp;<br>Several minutes of quiet, then the man&#x2019;s voice louder and footsteps coming her way. Dulled sound of stocking feet. Did that mean they would be staying?<br>&nbsp;<br>The man&#x2019;s voice from the hall. &#x201c;Got a nice bathroom. Nothing luxurious, but it&#x2019;s the location you&#x2019;re paying for. The tranquility.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The bedroom light came on and Sam held her breath. She couldn&#x2019;t see anything, the bedspread hanging almost to the floor.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Good-sized master bedroom. Room for a queen-size bed, obviously. Decent closet space. You might want to pick yourself out a different colour.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sound of closet doors sliding open.<br>&nbsp;<br>A woman&#x2019;...</p><h2>Icy Clutches (A Gideon Oliver Mysteries)</h2><p>While accompanying his wife to a forest rangers&#39; conference in Alaska&#39;s Glacier Bay, anthropology professor Gideon Oliver is called upon to practice his skeleton identification skills when human bones are discovered at a thirty-year-old avalanche site</p><p>Aaron Elkins is a former anthropologist and professor who has been writing mysteries and thrillers since 1982.

Minimal shelfwear. No markings. Pages are clean and bright. Binding is tight.</p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, November 2008</b>: Now that he's gotten us talking about the viral life of ideas and the power of gut reactions, Malcolm Gladwell poses a more provocative question in <em>Outliers</em>: why do some people succeed, living remarkably productive and impactful lives, while so many more never reach their potential? Challenging our cherished belief of the "self-made man," he makes the democratic assertion that superstars don't arise out of nowhere, propelled by genius and talent: "they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot." Examining the lives of outliers from Mozart to Bill Gates, he builds a convincing case for how successful people rise on a tide of advantages, "some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky."<br><br> <em>Outliers</em> can be enjoyed for its bits of trivia, like why most pro hockey players were born in January, how many hours of practice it takes to master a skill, why the descendents of Jewish immigrant garment workers became the most powerful lawyers in New York, how a pilots' culture impacts their crash record, how a centuries-old culture of rice farming helps Asian kids master math. But there's more to it than that. Throughout all of these examples--and in more that delve into the social benefits of lighter skin color, and the reasons for school achievement gaps--Gladwell invites conversations about the complex ways privilege manifests in our culture. He leaves us pondering the gifts of our own history, and how the world could benefit if more of our kids were granted the opportunities to fulfill their remarkable potential. --<em>Mari Malcolm</em><br><br>Malcolm Gladwell is the author of three other books, &#34;The Tipping Point,&#34; &#34;Blink,&#34; and &#34;What the Dog Saw,&#34; all of which are &#34;New York Times&#34; bestsellers.

And as this mind-blowing book explains, plans and efforts are being made now by global corporations and the U.S government to turn this advanced technology, these spychips, into a way to track our daily activities-and keep us all on Big Brother's short leash. Compiling massive amounts of research with firsthand knowledge, <em><strong>Spychips</strong></em> explains RFID technology and reveals the history and future of the master planners' strategies to imbed these trackers on everything-from postage stamps to shoes to people themselves-and spy on Americans without our knowledge or consent.

Secular liberals typically suppose that their positions on morally charged issues of public policy are the fruit of pure reason, while those of their morally conservative opponents reflect an irrational religious faith. George shows that this supposition is wrong on both counts. Challenging liberalism&#39;s claim to represent the triumph of reason, George argues that on controversial issues like abortion, euthanasia, same-sex unions, civil rights and liberties, and the place of religion in public life, traditional Judaeo-Christian beliefs are rationally superior to secular liberal alternatives. The Clash of Orthodoxies will shock liberals out of an unwarranted complacency and provide powerful ammunition for embattled defenders of traditional morality.</p><p>It is a common supposition among many of our cultural elites that a constitutional &#34;wall of separation&#34; between church and state precludes religious believers from bringing their beliefs to bear on public matters. This is because secular liberals typically assume that their own positions on morally charged issues of public policy are the fruit of pure reason, while those of their morally conservative opponents reflect an irrational religious faith. In The Clash of Orthodoxies: Law, Religion, and Morality in Crisis, Princeton political theorist Robert P. George shows that this supposition is wrong on both counts. Challenging liberalism&#39;s claim to represent the triumph of reason, George argues that on controversial issues like embryonic stem-cell research, abortion, euthanasia, homosexuality, and same-sex marriage, traditional Judeo-Christian beliefs are actually rationally superior to secular liberal alternatives. Drawing on the natural law philosophical tradition, George demolishes various secularist pretenses, such as the notion that the very young and very old among us are somehow subpersonal and not worthy of full legal protection. He reveals the dubious person-body dualism implicit in secularist arguments, and he demonstrates the flawed reasoning behind the idea that the state ought to be neutral regarding competing understandings of the nature and value of marriage. George also revisits the controversy surrounding his participation in the First Things &#34;End of Democracy?&#34; symposium, in which he considered the relevance of Catholic teachings regarding the legitimacy of political regimes to the contemporary American situation. George argues that because natural law and natural rights doctrine lie at the foundation of the American republic, the judicial reading of the Constitution that has undermined democracy in order to enshrine the secularist agenda is deeply flawed. In advancing his thesis, George argues for a return to old-fashioned liberalism, a worldview that he claims is best exemplified by Pope John Paul II, whose teachings laud democracy, religious liberty, and economic freedom while also recognizing the demands of civil rights, social and economic justice, and the principle of subsidiarity. These demands restrain Catholics--and indeed all people of faith--from making personal freedom an absolute, and George takes to task those political leaders who, though believers, have denied or ignored the political responsibility this entails. The Clash of Orthodoxies is a profoundly important contribution to our contemporary national conversation about the proper role of religion in politics. The lucid and persuasive prose of Robert George, one of America&#39;s most prominent public intellectuals, will shock secular liberals out of an unwarranted complacency and provide powerful ammunition for embattled defenders of traditional morality.Robert P.

Despite this long history, a clear and coherent picture of Jesus as a man and a teacher has remained elusive. Now, Bruce Chilton puts the pieces of the puzzle together in an extraordinary biography that sweeps readers into first-century Palestine and re-creates the world as Jesus knew it. <br>Chilton draws on recent archaeological findings to paint a vivid portrait of the social customs, political forces, and religious beliefs and practices of the period. Examining new translations and interpretations of ancient texts against this fresh, historically accurate background, he offers a revolutionary look at Jesus' early life and the philosophical and psychological foundations of the ideas he promulgated as a young man. Chilton provides evidence that contradicts long-held beliefs about Jesus and the movement he led. He shows, for example, that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Galilee, not Nazareth or Bethlehem of Judea, and that the High Priest Caiaphas, not Pontius Pilate, played the central role in Jesus' execution. It is his description of Jesus' role as a rabbi, or "master," of Jewish oral traditions, a teacher of the Kabbalah, and a practitioner of a Galilean form of Judaism that emphasized direct communication with God, however, that casts an entirely new light on the origins of Christianity. By placing Jesus within the context of his times, Chilton uncovers truths lost to history and reveals a new Jesus for the new millennium.<br></p><p>Bruce Chilton presents <i>Rabbi Jesus</i> as "the first comprehensive, critical biography of Jesus to date." Though historical Jesus scholars have "demolished the secularist myth that Jesus was a figment of faith," and have begun to describe his ministry in the context of first century Judaism, Chilton (a professor of religion at Bard College and an Episcopal priest) believes they have not gone far enough. He argues that Jesus was "an inspired rabbi with an exclusively Jewish agenda." Thus, "everything Jesus did was as a Jew, for Jews, and about Jews." <i>Rabbi Jesus</i> patiently explores these notions in a straightforward, accessible style, drawing on a wealth of Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic, Coptic, and Syriac texts. Many of his arguments are new, and many of them are convincing. Most of them will also make the majority of both Christians and Jews sufficiently uncomfortable as to justify Chilton's striking description of his own work, taken from the book's Foreward: "I sometimes feel as if I am cross-dressing: transgressing basic categories that define who we are [as Christians and as Jews] and how we differentiate ourselves in the world." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>advance praise for <b>Rabbi Jesus</b>:<br><br>"A dynamic book by a penetrating thinker. Bruce Chilton has added enormously to the contemporary development of Jesus scholarship by placing Jesus inside the Jewish tradition that illuminates both his words and his deeds.

Chilton's masterful knowledge of Jewish Palestine and Jewish custom and his penetrating insight into the development and meaning of Jesus' teaching and experience of God form the backdrop of a compelling and stimulating narrative. Readers will find it hard to put this book down!"<br>--Craig A. Evans, Professor and Director, Graduate Program in Biblical Studies, Trinity Western University, British Columbia<br><br>"Rabbi Jesus is as close as any reader is likely to get to the historical Jesus. Drawing on his profound knowledge of the ancient literature and archaeology, Bruce Chilton uses this scholarship and an informed imagination to present a bold biography of Jesus.

Not many listen though. That&#x2019;s the problem.<br> <br>&#x2014;A. A. MILNE<br> <br>I sat in my office and watched a video of a male Golden retriever going insane.<br> <br>The footage was murky because it was shot in a darkened house at night. The animal was sleeping peacefully on his blanket, the picture of domestic peace, until his muzzle began to twitch. In a gradual transformation reminiscent of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the twitching became more rapid, and suddenly, the beast jumped up and attacked his own bed.<br> <br>The Golden&#x2019;s name was Comet, and the speed of his abrupt assault was worthy of his name. His targets varied, according to his owner. On the video, Comet attacked a blanket, snarling, snapping, and ripping the thing to shreds, but his owner told me that he also occasionally tore into his canine housemate, an English setter, sending the poor thing yowling in retreat. Somehow the violence appeared just as vicious when Comet&#x2019;s prey was an innocent patch of fabric.<br> <br>I looked from the monitor to the dog who lay placidly at my feet. This was the monster I had just witnessed going berserk? During the day Comet was a gentle dog who would happily play-wrestle with the English setter and always lose, content to end up on his back on the ground with the setter lording it over him. At night, though, he became aggressive. Even though the attacks were over in a few seconds, they were scary to watch.<br> <br>In my practice as a professor of veterinary science specializing in animal behavior, I had encountered such episodes before. A bull terrier would wake abruptly in a rage and attack a door. Another bull terrier would try to attack his master, though I had advised her to attach him to a metal leash that was long enough for him to move around but not so long that he could reach her while she was sleeping. More than once she woke up with the dog snarling and snapping inches from her face. She was extremely grateful for that metal leash!<br> <br>The cause behind each unusual behavior in pets is a puzzle to be solved. Sometimes they&#x2019;re multiple. Sometimes they&#x2019;re biological. But sometimes biological causes create psychological problems. Comet the loving, playful sweetie pie became Comet the snarling nighttime werewolf. Bully the loving pet and Bully the berserker. Every owner of every dog has a secret knowledge, at times relished, at times feared, that there is an animal in the house who back in the mists of time was once a wild beast. But when a dog inexplicably reverts to its wolflike nature, can anything be done?<br> <br>I diagnosed a neurological problem in Comet, a possible seizure disorder, so I prescribed meds that had anticonvulsant properties. With a combination of clonazepam, a Valium-type anticonvulsant, and phenobarbital, Comet&#x2019;s nighttime attacks reduced considerably.<br> <br>For other dogs suffering similar issues, I used similar approaches. The metal-leashed bull terrier responded well to Prozac, which has antiepileptic as well as mood-stabilizing properties, and he stopped his nightly attack. Later I was able to keep him calm by switching him from Prozac to nighttime melatonin, which is also considered something of an anticonvulsant.<br> <br>Let&#x2019;s stop a moment and take a deep breath. The preceding paragraph might strike you as worrisome. &#x201c;Dr. Dodman, you propose to give my pet what?&#x201d; Many pet owners prefer to hear about herbal remedies and nonpharmacological measures. And of course we often employ them, too. But I&#x2019;m going to suggest that treating animals with human medications is not an instance of Big Pharma run amok. In the course of this book, I hope you will come to see the simple, practical truth. Modern medicines work. They alleviate suffering and save lives.<br> <br>Such treatment approaches weren&#x2019;t arrived at by luck, and weren&#x2019;t random stabs at a cure, either. I knew how to address Comet&#x2019;s problem because, long before he came into my examining room, I had embarked upon a quest to understand such bizarre aggressive episodes. I delved into the available research on animals and had also reached across the species barrier to investigate the basis for sudden unexplained aggression in humans. When I put it all together, it seemed clear that there was a neurological trigger for what was happening.<br> <br>The dogs weren&#x2019;t choosing to go berserk. Their attacks weren&#x2019;t the result of bad dreams. The afflicted animals were experiencing seizures, the result of misfires deep within the brain.<br> <br>In my search of the available case histories I encountered many accounts of nocturnal seizures, and most were expressed as aggression. Why did such episodes occur only at night? Once again, the available case histories have long shown that sleep can promote seizures in people. It turns out that some natural mechanisms that inhibit behavior are switched off in deep sleep.<br> <br>Back then, at the dawn of my career as an animal behaviorist, we didn&#x2019;t know much about the neural processes involved in this often upsetting and sometimes dangerous behavior. So I recruited fellow researchers to develop a way of addressing it. Our approach was remarkable in one respect: we proposed to treat animals with many of the same treatments that are successful in healing people.<br> <br>On the one hand, our method might seem obvious. Human beings and canines are both vertebrates, both mammals. We are evolutionary relatives&#x2014;distant relatives, but relatives all the same. Complex partial seizures are more common than grand mal seizures in people, so it made sense to assume that dogs had a high incidence of complex partial seizures, too. Why shouldn&#x2019;t we find common treatments of our shared pathologies?<br> <br>But science doesn&#x2019;t assume. Science proves. Obvious as our hypothesis might be, there was a problem verifying it: How could we really tell when partial seizures were happening in dogs? People can describe experiences to their doctors, but animals obviously cannot. This probably explains why complex partial seizures remain undiagnosed by many veterinarians.<br> <br>Despite the obvious success of the treatment regimens I was developing, many veterinary behaviorists were skeptical that seizure-based aggression existed. An eminent animal behaviorist, Dr. Ilana Reisner, who did her research for her doctoral thesis on springer spaniel aggression, stopped short of saying definitively the condition was seizure-based. One widely accepted textbook labeled sudden violent aggression in dogs as &#x201c;idiopathic,&#x201d; a wonderful five-dollar word that simply means the cause is undetermined. It&#x2019;s what vets and doctors alike say when they are loathe to pronounce their least favorite three-word phrase: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>For all this academic back-and-forth, animals were still coming to vets in distress. Successfully treating patients was one thing. Verifying the cause of their behavior was quite another.<br> <br>A vital step along the way came when I saw Brock, a really big,150-pound Chesapeake Bay retriever, whose aggression was completely out of control. The dog had put his owner in the hospital on more than one occasion. He was such a beast that he would even steal wineglasses and crush them in his jaws in front of his terrified owner. If the owner attempted to intervene, the dog would attack her viciously.<br> <br>It was hard to understand how this much-bitten owner remained loyal to her dog, but love often wins out with pets. Fortunately, she brought Brock in to see me, and I in turn discussed the case with Dr. Klaus Miczek, a fellow Tufts professor, who agreed that partial seizures, or temporal lobe epilepsy, might be behind the savage attacks.<br> <br>Dr. Miczek told me of a human equivalent called &#x201c;episodic dyscontrol,&#x201d; a seizure-based condition that makes people respond violently and disproportionately to trivial triggers. Since this kind of condition existed in humans, it was conceivable that it could appear in dogs. It also gave us an encouraging sign for a possible treatment.<br> <br>Klaus and I, together with veterinary neurologist, Dr. Johann Thalhammer, gave the dog an EEG, an electroencephalogram, which is used to detect abnormalities in electrical impulses in the brain. Sure enough, the results of Brock&#x2019;s EEG indicated a large complex spiking of electric impulses in the temporal lobe region, which in both dogs and people is considered &#x201c;command central&#x201d; of emotional control. The electrical activity detected in Brock&#x2019;s case was a sure sign of episodic dyscontrol or partial seizures.<br> <br>Since a single case isn&#x2019;t enough to sustain a hypothesis, we examined two other dogs who had violent uncontrolled aggression and found that they also displayed similar abnormal electrical activity. All three dogs suffered bizarre mood changes right before their attacks began, then explosive aggression directed at people or objects.<br> <br>The poor dogs! They weren&#x2019;t choosing to be aggressive. Their behavior wasn&#x2019;t purposeful. All three dogs responded well to a treatment of phenobarbital, a medicine also widely prescribed to humans in cases of epilepsy. This was not coincidence. What works in people turns out to work well in canines. All the owners of the treated dogs considered the improvement unqualified successes. They had saved their dogs.<br> <br>So, happy endings all around. It&#x2019;s a treatment approach that I&#x2019;ve used over and over throughout the years since, from Brock all the way forward to Comet. The pattern of positive outcomes points to a fundamental truth that I have spent my whole career attempting to fully understand. If I find behavior in an animal that I don&#x2019;t understand, I often look at similar behaviors in our own species to discover an effective method of treatment. Seizures in dogs? Why not look into the history of seizures in humans?<br> <br>Despite publication of our evidence for the existence of episodic dyscontrol in dogs, however, some of my colleagues still refuse to accept it as possible. It is often hard to convince people that what they have believed for years is not true. I usually calculate that it takes about twenty years after publication of a new concept for it to enter the mainstream and become accepted. If that is the case, then the present time is just about right for that to happen.<br> <br>In these specific instances&#x2014;in the cases of the canine wineglass crusher, the metal-leash strainer, the fearsome blanket ripper&#x2014;we just may win the battle to save animals&#x2019; lives. But the wider war is ongoing. The real fight to save animals from destructive behavior&#x2014;and from being euthanized or destroyed&#x2014;is just beginning.<br> <br>Are animals like us? Are we like them? Do they have intelligence? Do they have emotions? Can they suffer as we do? Most people who live with pets answer these questions with a rousing affirmative, as do veterinarians like me. Deep in their hearts, people who routinely work with livestock and farm animals would also agree&#x2014;even though they might be loath to admit it, since their jobs may depend on ignoring such hard truths.<br> <br>But there is one group that stubbornly resists acknowledging the validity of such propositions. Powerful sectors of the scientific community deny suppositions that seem perfectly obvious to lay people. The &#x201c;real&#x201d; scientists inform us that we must interpret animal behavior in mechanistic terms, rather than attributing what we see to higher brain functions.<br> <br>Is your cat jealous? Does your dog exhibit empathy? Is a horse who continually paces her stall experiencing anxiety? No, no, and no, answer these stern arbiters of scientific purity. It&#x2019;s all reflex, not cognition, they say. Our pets are different from us, they say, and cannot share our thought processes.<br> <br>Wary of appearing less rigorous than befits a scientist, the naysayer police protect the borders of the realm of Homo sapiens, turning away incursions from the wider animal kingdom. They are the champions of human exceptionalism.<br> <br>So, okay. Maybe we just have a difference of opinion. Perhaps we are being soft-headed when we think Fluffy looks happy today when she looked sad yesterday. The average pet owner believes one way, the research scientist another. What does it really matter?<br> <br>It might make no difference at all, except for one thing: animals are dying by the thousands because of obstinate, outmoded notions about their emotions and behavior. As a society, we have refused to make strides in understanding our pets because we are locked into old biases that limit vital avenues of research. As surely as the carriage horses who clop along the lanes of New York&#x2019;s Central Park, the scientific community wears blinders in its approach to animal behavior.<br> <br>Meanwhile, &#x201c;bad behavior&#x201d; is the number one killer of pets in the United States.<br> <br>What? How can that be? The leading killer of dogs and cats surely must be something like cancer, heart ailments, or simple old age. The toll of these diseases is, of course, high, but none can match the slaughter done in the name of bad behavior. It happens too often even to be remarkable. What is the answer when a dog turns aggressive and starts attacking people? When a cat becomes incontinent and fouls a new carpet? Off to the pound with it! Euthanasia is such a bland name for what actually occurs. A pity, but it has to be done.<br> <br>But does it have to be done?<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve devoted my professional life to finding answers to why an animal&#x2019;s behavior goes awry. My method is simple: I emphasize similarities rather than differences between humans and other animals. What works in treating people who suffer from persistent anxiety? What serves to lessen obsessive-compulsive tendencies in humans? Could the same treatments work on pets?<br> <br>I call my approach One Medicine.<br> <br>Using the principles of One Medicine, I&#x2019;ve treated anxiety in pets with human antianxiety medication, obsessive-compulsive disorder with prescription anti-obsessional drugs, hyperactivity with stimulants, complex partial seizures with conventional anticonvulsants or an anticonvulsant herbal derivative. If I were a physician, none of these measures would be noteworthy. But I am a professor of veterinary science, and I&#x2019;ve experienced pushback from my fellow scientists, including reactions from raised eyebrows to out-and-out obstruction.<br> <br>Once I was on a conference call with other scientists to decide funding for research into OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder. I ventured that a proposed genetic study employing dogs as a model of the human condition was worthy of funding. A lively discussion ensued among the assembled throng and I fielded several questions through the speakerphone. There I was, Professor Nicholas H. Dodman, BVMS, DACVB, a veterinarian wired in to a large gathering of MDs&#x2014;most of them psychiatrists specializing in OCD treatment.<br> <br>Then came a disembodied voice from one of the psychiatrists on the line. &#x201c;You will never be able to discover anything about human beings by studying dogs,&#x201d; the voice said sternly. &#x201c;I am going to blackball this grant.&#x201d; I never nailed down who the speaker was, but to me, he represents a whole host of pigheaded conservatives who remain mired in the past. His voice haunts me. I am determined to prove him wrong.<br> <br>On a kinder and gentler note, I recall a long conversation I once had about animal intelligence with a former Harvard professor named Dr. Marc Hauser. Trim, lively, and goateed, Marc was deep into the study of primate behavior and animal cognition. We agreed on practically every aspect of animal intelligence, includ...</p><h2>Solidarity Ethics: Transformation in a Globalized World</h2><p>Rebecca Todd Peters argues for an ethic of solidarity as a new model for how people of faith in the first world can live with integrity in the midst of global injustice and shape a more just future.<p>Addressing the economic and social structures of our globalized context, Peters shows how a concrete ethics rooted in the Christian tradition of justice and transformation is deeply informed by solidarity and relationality.

Royal Country Down, Royal Portrush, Portmarnock, Portstewart, Waterville and the Island, the European Club and Baltry -- any one of these would be reason to cross an ocean, and the concentration of all of them on a land mass smaller than the state of Maine makes for a golfer's paradise limited only by your budget and your time. <br> For the tourist or the dreamer, there can be no better guide than James W. Finegan. A passionate advocate and a charming storyteller, Finegan combines a writer's eye, a historian's knowledge, and a golfer's sense of wonder and apprehension to provide an impossibly ambitious grand tour of this beautiful land. In a loop that begins in the West at Lahinch and continues clockwise through both the Republic and Northern Ireland, Finegan covers more than fifty courses, visiting those that have become true shrines of the game, the courses that are well known and respected, and the little-known gems you might otherwise pass right by. He shares the history of the courses, and writes marvelously about the scenic and strategic charms to be found as you play them yourself. And he provides all the information you need to make your arrangements to do just that -- because unlike most championship courses in the United States, the great courses of Ireland are available to the public. <br> In addition to his delightful descriptions of the golf to be found there, Finegan gives us his recommendations for places to stay, ranging from the most modest bed and breakfast to the most magnificent palace -- some thirty accommodations in all. He describes the pleasures to be found off the beaten track: the spectacular views from a country road, or the ancient cathedral that's worth a stop on the way to the first tee. And because all the travel within the country is done by car, he spells out the actual route from town to town and course to course, as he lays out an itinerary that will surely encounter almost all of the fabled "40 shades of green." <br> <i>Emerald Fairways and Foam-Flecked Seas</i> is a book to be read, to be savored, and to be tucked away in your suitcase when you finally undertake the journey of your dreams.</p><p>Few men know the golf courses of Scotland and Ireland better than Jim Finegan, and no man writes of them more movingly. On one level this is an indispensable guidebook; on another -- in the tradition of Bernard Darwin -- it is simply a great read. -- George Peper, Editor-in-Chief, Golf Magazine<b>James W. Finegan</b> has made more than forty trips to the United Kingdom and Ireland since 1971, always with his golf clubs in tow. He has written extensively about the pleasures of links golf for <i>Golf Magazine, Golf Journal,</i> the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer,</i> and a variety of other publications.

So when a conflict breaks out between the hummingbirds and the chipmunks, she steps forward to act as a mediator, but nothing she says seems to help. Will Beck be able to bring peace to the animals?</p><p>A squirrel perched on a log paused while chewing on some seeds. He watched as two tiny Never fairies zipped past him, side by side. <br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Beck,&#x201d; one of the fairies said to the other as they flew. &#x201c;Thank you so much for coming with me.&#x201d; She looked terribly worried. &#x201c;We just don&#x2019;t know what to do. A baby raccoon turned up in the gardens this morning, and he ate all the strawberries out of Thistle&#x2019;s strawberry patch. And then he started digging up Rosetta&#x2019;s mint! We chased him off, but he didn&#x2019;t go far. Now he&#x2019;s sitting on a tree stump by Havendish Stream. He won&#x2019;t budge. And none of the other animal-talent fairies can understand a word he&#x2019;s saying!&#x201d;<br><br>Beck smiled. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Latia,&#x201d; she said. They were nearing Havendish Stream. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll figure it out.&#x201d; <br><br>Latia breathed a sigh of relief. &#x201c;Well, if any fairy in Never Land can figure it out, it&#x2019;s you, Beck!&#x201d;<br><br>Every fairy in Never Land agreed: Beck was one of the finest animal-talent fairies in Pixie Hollow. She loved being around animals, from the tiniest insects to the largest mammals. Oh, sure, snakes could be a little grumpy. Skunks were hard to read. And hawks, of course, were just plain dangerous. But all in all, she loved feeling a part of the animal world. Sometimes Beck secretly wished that she were an animal!<br><br>Like all the animal-talent fairies, Beck had a gift for talking to animals. Birdcalls, mouse squeaks, squirrel and chipmunk chatter&#x2013;they were just noises to the other fairies. But to animal-talent fairies, those different noises held meaning. To them, animal sounds were as clear and easy to understand as words and sentences. <br><br>Beck was especially good at talking to baby animals, perhaps because she was so playful and lighthearted. She loved playing hide-and-seek with the young squirrels and having somersault contests with the baby hedgehogs. Even when an animal was too young to speak, Beck could understand it. Queen Clarion said Beck had empathy and could sense animals&#x2019; emotions. When those emotions were strong enough, Beck felt them, too.<br><br>So when a baby raccoon parked himself on a stump and refused to move, everyone thought of Beck right away. The animal fairies sent Latia to fetch Beck because she was a forest-talent fairy and knew the quickest ways to get through Pixie Hollow.<br><br>An easy five-minute flight later, the two fairies came to Havendish Stream. A dozen animal-talent fairies were hovering around a tiny raccoon, who sat on a tree stump clutching a stalk of Rosetta&#x2019;s mint.<br><br>&#x201c;Beck&#x2019;s here!&#x201d; Latia called, and all the fairies turned. <br><br>&#x201c;Oh, thank goodness!&#x201d; cried Fawn, one of Beck&#x2019;s best friends. She drew Beck closer to the tree stump. &#x201c;Beck, you&#x2019;ve just got to help. This poor little fella won&#x2019;t budge. We don&#x2019;t even know where he came from.&#x201d; With a push from Fawn, Beck found herself right in front of the baby raccoon. He raised his head and whimpered. <br><br>&#x201c;Hello there,&#x201d; Beck said in Raccoon. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Beck. What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br><br>The little raccoon let out another whimper. Then he buried his face in his paws and rubbed his nose in the stalk of mint he had picked from Rosetta&#x2019;s garden.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t cry!&#x201d; Beck said. She flew up and stroked the top of the raccoon&#x2019;s furry head. The raccoon rocked back and forth&#x2013;and Beck&#x2019;s lip started trembling. The baby raccoon was so sad and so scared that Beck was starting to feel sad, too. She straightened her back, cleared her throat, and forced herself to cheer up. If she didn&#x2019;t watch out, soon she&#x2019;d be crying as hard as the little raccoon, and then where would the fairies be?<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, now,&#x201d; said Beck, smiling. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t cry, my friend. Why would you cry when you could be playing a game with me?&#x201d;<br><br>Raising his head, the little raccoon looked at Beck for the first time. She smiled encouragingly and patted his nose. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I know the perfect game for us to play. It&#x2019;s called Find the Fairy!&#x201d;Gr. 1-3. Following Gail Carson Levine's leadoff Fairy Dust and the Quest for the Egg (2005) comes Disney Fairies, a series of chapter books, written by various authors, that take place in Never Land's fairy kingdom, Pixie Hollow. In this offering, Beck, an animal-talent fairy, must stop a war between chipmunks and hummingbirds that threatens to divide the entire forest. Despite contrived plotting and a predictable solution just shy of sentimental, the warring animals' childlike feud and the gentle lesson at the heart of the story will resonate with a young audience. The few sample full-color illustrations included in the galley were ornate and stylized, with a slick, airbrushed look and fairies with wide eyes and voluptuous lips; the full set of final illustrations was not available.

Many non-narrative therapists have expressed great admiration and interests in the politics the work exposes, the way it brings in the socio-political context, and the way it centers clients. Yet despite its popularity and success as a useful therapeutic approach, Narrative Therapy has been criticized as minimizing and failing to develop any extended discussion of something vital to our lives: emotion.</p><p><em>Neuro-Narrative Therapy</em>&nbsp;attempts to redress this problem by taking us first through standard Narrative practices, and then showing how and where affect can be brought in and even privileged in the work.</p><p>After situating the evolution of Narrative Therapy in its historical context, the book provides information about why emotions should be given an important place in the work. Specifically, it brings ideas and implications of some of the most exciting and novel theories&#x2015;interpersonal neurobiology and affective neuroscience&#x2015;to the practice of Narrative Therapy.</p><p>Readers will learn about the growing emphasis on the right brain, and how an understanding of the ways in which emotion and affect are manifested by the brain can help us help our clients. The possibilities for this new approach are many: a freer discussion of the emotional side of your clients; an understanding and sensitivity to the relation of body and mind; attention to how the therapeutic relationship of our clients can become a resource in treatment and a renewed understanding of how our memories&#x2015;and thus our stories about our lives&#x2015;develop in early childhood and beyond.</p><p>For any therapist working in the area of Narrative Therapy, and for any interested in the emerging understandings that science is bringing to appreciating how our brains develop with and among each other, this book has something to offer. Combining the neuro- and the narrative, as Jeffrey Zimmerman has done here, will create a new direction in Narrative Therapy, one in which our brain and body work together, inviting a more direct and effective engagement with clients.</p></p><p>Jeffrey Zimmerman, PhD, is Director of Bay Area Family Therapy Training Associates. He was the first to bring interpersonal neurobiology into Narrative Therapy work. He has published extensively, given workshops internationally, and trained numerous therapists in Narrative Therapy. He has been an licensed psychologist for over 35 years.&#x201c;Zimmerman has done an excellent job of evolving narrative therapy to include interpersonal neurobiology and explaining how he came upon this road. . . . [H]e has created a new story in the context of his experience as a narrative therapist and a self-aware, caring person. Both his heart and his mind shine together in this book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Psych Central</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This book brings disparate fields (Narrative Therapy, Interpersonal Neurobiology and Affective Neuroscience) together in ways that significantly moves our field forward. Zimmerman has always been something of an outsider, pushing the boundaries of the field while connecting it to current culture (particularly music and video). This book continues those efforts and moves into entirely new territory. Read it and it is likely to blow your mind and get you thinking in ways you may never have considered.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>William Madsen, PhD, Director of the Family-Centered Services Project and author of <em>Collaborative Therapy with Multi-Stressed Families</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Would that all therapists write as clearly about theory and practice as Jeff Zimmerman! With an astonishing capacity to travel across the rigors of neurobiology and the complexities of narrative therapy, <em>Neuro-Narrative Therapy</em> offers the missing link between the conscious purpose of a post-structural practice with the emotional currents of the body and attention to this affect. Zimmerman is one of only a few to be counted as a first-generation narrative therapist, so I can assure you he did not write this book to look cool among his peers, since many&#x2015;including myself&#x2015;tried to talk him out of it. <em>Neuro-Narrative Therapy</em> has changed my opinion enough to reconsider the relational/emotional body he escorts into therapy. I am utterly thrilled with this contribution and its deft ability to transport narrative practice forward&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Stephen Madigan, MSW, MSc, PhD, Director, Vancouver School for Narrative Therapy</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Zimmerman's ideas in this book on Neuro-Narrative therapy profoundly influenced my work as a Narrative consultant and coach in the organizational field. These ideas and practices have transformed my way of working with and training of narrative ideas to include significant moments that honor our embodied knowledge and invite affect as a participant in the room with us.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Chen� Swart, South African narrative consultant, coach, and author of <em>Re-authoring the World</em></strong></p><h2>Ikea the Book: Designers, Products and Other Stuff (Pink Cover)</h2><p>''Not for the rich but for the smart'' - a perfect motto for IKEA, the company that has spent half a century democratizing good design. This monumental, lavishly illustrated book - almost 500 full-color pages as full of beauty, bright ideas and cool surprises as a visit to IKEA itself - is the first complete presentation ever of the phenomenon that is the world's most successful furniture enterprise. It's an incredible resource for anyone interested in contemporary design and consumer culture. <br><br>From Swedish publisher Arvinius, this book tells IKEA's story from its origins as a mail-order company. It details breakthroughs like the invention of the hex wrench and the flat pack, which let the cutting-edge retail giant serve almost 600 million customers in 25 countries in 2009. Chapters showcase the hit parade of the most popular pieces over the decades (the Billy bookshelf has sold millions), and interviews with some of the chain's top designers reveal their surprising passion for the store and its visionary founder, Ingvar Kamprad. <br><br>This first-edition book itself is destined to be a collector's edition: impeccably printed in Europe, it is published with three different cover colors (pink, green and brown, each with its own ISBN). After a year or so, IKEA will offer its own mass-produced version in a smaller trim size and lower print quality.

Alone in this knowledge, he comes of age in rural Maine grappling with the question: <i>Does anything I do matter?</i> While the voice that has accompanied him since conception appraises his choices, Junior's loved ones emerge with parallel stories-his anxious mother; his brother, a cocaine addict turned pro-baseball phenomenon; his exalted father, whose own mortality summons Junior's best and worst instincts; and Amy, the love of Junior's life and a North Star to his journey through romance and heartbreak, drug-addled despair, and superheroic feats that could save humanity. While our recognizable world is transformed into a bizarre nation at endgame, where government agents conspire in subterranean bunkers, preparing citizens for emigration from a doomed planet, Junior's final triumph confounds all expectation, building to an astonishing and deeply moving resolution. Ron Currie, Jr., gets to the heart of character, and the voices who narrate this uniquely American tour de force leave an indelible, exhilarating impression.<br><br></p><p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, June 2009:</strong> On the day that Junior Thibodeau is born, he learns the exact moment when the world will end: 36 years, 168 days, 14 hours, and 23 seconds into the future--pretty heavy news for a newborn. Knowledge of the pending apocalypse--revealed by an omniscient, unnamed "we"--colors Junior's existence from day one and leaves him wondering: "Does anything I do matter?" Ron Currie, Jr.'s terrific debut novel unfolds through the funny, poignant, and tragic stories told by Junior and his family, (each of them owning a chapter) including the all-knowing Greek chorus that gently, affectionately nudges Junior toward his destiny. <em>Everything Matters!</em> is one of the most unique novels I've come across this year--unpredictable without being flashy, sweet without being sentimental, thoughtful without being preachy--a fun read that will keep you thinking long after the story is over. --<em>Daphne Durham</em></p>Ron Currie Jr. is a native of Waterville, Maine, and whose fiction has appeared in <i>Glimmer Train</i>, <i>The Sun</i>, <i>Other Voices</i> and <i>Night Train</i>.

This is just the beginning of a struggle between Bond and Scaramanga, the one they call &#34;the man with the golden gun&#34;.</p><p>Ian Fleming was born in London on May 28, 1908. He was educated at Eton College and later spent a formative period studying languages in Europe. His first job was with Reuters News Agency where a Moscow posting gave him firsthand experience with what would become his literary <i>bete noire</i>&#x2014;the Soviet Union. During World War II he served as Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence and played a key role in Allied espionage operations. <p>After the war he worked as foreign manager of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, a job that allowed him to spend two months each year in Jamaica. Here, in 1952, at his home &#x201c;Goldeneye,&#x201d; he wrote a book called <i>Casino Royale</i>&#x2014;and James Bond was born. The first print run sold out within a month. For the next twelve years Fleming produced a novel a year featuring Special Agent 007, the most famous spy of the century. His travels, interests, and wartime experience lent authority to everything he wrote.

'CAN I HELP YOU?'</b></p> <p>The Secret Service holds much that is kept secret even from very senior officers in the organisation. Only M and his Chief of Staff know absolutely everything there is to know. The latter is responsible for keeping the Top Secret record known as 'The War Book' so that, in the event of the death of both of them, the whole story, apart from what is available to individual Sections and Stations, would be available to their successors.</p> <p>One thing that James Bond, for instance, didn't know was the machinery at Headquarters for dealing with the public, whether friendly or otherwise - drunks, lunatics, bona fide applications to join the Service, and enemy agents with plans for penetration or even assassination.</p> <p>On that cold, clear morning in November he was to see the careful cog-wheels in motion.</p> <p>The girl at the switchboard at the Ministry of Defence flicked the switch to 'Hold' and said to her neighbour, 'It's another nut who says he's James Bond. Even knows his code number. Says he wants to speak to M personally.'</p> <p>The senior girl shrugged. The switchboard had had quite a few such calls since, a year before, James Bond's death on a mission to Japan had been announced in the Press. There had even been one pestiferous woman who, at every full moon, passed on messages from Bond from Uranus where it seemed he had got stuck while awaiting entry into heaven. She said, 'Put him through to Liaison, Pat.'</p> <p>The Liaison Section was the first cog in the machine, the first sieve. The operator got back on the line: 'Just a moment, sir. I'll put you on to an officer who may be able to help you.'</p> <p>James Bond, sitting on the edge of his bed, said, 'Thank you.'</p> <p>He had expected some delay before he could establish his identity. He had been warned to expect it by the charming 'Colonel Boris' who had been in charge of him for the past few months after he had finished his treatment in the luxurious Institute on the Nevsky Prospekt in Leningrad. A man's voice came on the line. 'Captain Walker speaking. Can I help you?'</p> <p>James Bond spoke slowly and clearly. 'This is Commander James Bond speaking. Number 007. Would you put me through to M, or his secretary, Miss Moneypenny. I want to make an appointment.'</p> <p>Captain Walker pressed two buttons on the side of his telephone. One of them switched on a tape recorder for the use of his department, the other alerted one of the duty officers in the Action Room of the Special Branch at Scotland Yard that he should listen to the conversation, trace the call, and at once put a tail on the caller. It was now up to Captain Walker, who was in fact an extremely bright ex-prisoner-of-war interrogator from Military Intelligence, to keep the subject talking for as near five minutes as possible. He said, 'I'm afraid I don't know either of these two people. Are you sure you've got the right number?'</p> <p>James Bond patiently repeated the Regent number which was the main outside line for the Secret Service. Together with so much else, he had forgotten it, but Colonel Boris had known it and had made him write it down among the small print on the front page of his forged British passport that said his name was Frank Westmacott, company director.</p> <p>'Yes,' said Captain Walker sympathetically. 'We seem to have got that part of it right. But I'm afraid I can't place these people you want to talk to. Who exactly are they? This Mr Em, for instance. I don't think we've got anyone of that name at the Ministry.'</p> <p>'Do you want me to spell it out? You realise this is an open line?'</p> <p>Captain Walker was rather impressed by the confidence in the speaker's voice. He pressed another button and, so that Bond would hear it, a telephone bell rang. He said, 'Hang on a moment, would you? There's someone on my other line.' Captain Walker got on to the head of his Section. ' Sorry, sir. I've got a chap on who says he's James Bond and wants to talk to M. I know it sounds crazy and I've gone through the usual motions with the Special Branch and so on, but would you mind listening for a minute? Thank you, sir.'</p> <p>Two rooms away a harassed man, who was the Chief Security Officer for the Secret Service, said 'Blast!' and pressed a switch. A microphone on his desk came to life. The Chief Security Officer sat very still. He badly needed a cigarette, but his room was now 'live' to Captain Walker and to the lunatic who called himself 'James Bond'. Captain Walker's voice came over at full strength. 'I'm sorry. Now then. This man Mr Em you want to talk to. I'm sure we needn't worry about security. Could you be more specific?'</p> <p>James Bond frowned. He didn't know that he had frowned and he wouldn't have been able to explain why he had done so. He said, and lowered his voice, again inexplicably, 'Admiral Sir Miles Messervy. He is head of a department in your Ministry. The number of his room used to be twelve on the eighth floor. He used to have a secretary called Miss Moneypenny. Good-looking girl. Brunette. Shall I give you the Chief of Staff's name? No? Well let's see, it's Wednesday. Shall I tell you what'll be the main dish on the menu in the canteen? It should be steak-and-kidney pudding.'</p> <p>The Chief Security Officer picked up the direct telephone to Captain Walker. Captain Walker said to James Bond,' Damn! There's the other telephone again. Shan't be a minute.' He picked up the green telephone. 'Yes, sir?' '</p> <p>I don't like that bit about the steak-and-kidney pudding. Pass him on to the Hard Man. No. Cancel that. Make it the Soft. There was always something odd about 007's death. No body. No solid evidence. And the people on that Japanese island always seemed to me to be playing it pretty close to the chest. The Stone Face act. It's just possible. Keep me informed, would you?'</p> <p>Captain Walker got back to James Bond. 'Sorry about that. It's being a busy day. Now then, this inquiry of yours. Afraid I can't help you myself. Not my part of the Ministry. The man you want is Major Townsend. He should be able to locate this man you want to see. Got a pencil? It's No. 44 Kensington Cloisters. Got that? Kensington double five double five. Give me ten minutes and I'll have a word with him and see if he can help. All right?'</p> <p>James Bond said dully, 'That's very kind of you.' He put down the telephone. He waited exactly ten minutes and picked up the receiver and asked for the number.</p> <p>James Bond was staying at the Ritz Hotel. Colonel Boris had told him to do so. Bond's file in the KGB Archive described him as a high-liver, so, on arrival in London, he must stick to the KGB image of the high life. Bond went down in the lift to the Arlington Street entrance. A man at the news stand got a good profile of him with a buttonhole Minox. When Bond went down the shallow steps to the street and asked the commissionaire for a taxi, a canonflex with a telescopic lens clicked away busily from a Red Roses laundry van at the neighbouring goods entrance and, in due course, the same van followed Bond's taxi while a man inside the van reported briefly to the Action Room of the Special Branch.</p> <p>No. 44 Kensington Cloisters was a dull Victorian mansion in grimy red brick. It had been chosen for its purpose because it had once been the headquarters of the Empire League for Noise Abatement, and its entrance still bore the brass plate of this long-defunct organisation, the empty shell of which had been purchased by the Secret Service through the Commonwealth Relations Office. It also had a spacious old-fashioned basement, re-equipped as detention cells, and a rear exit into a quiet mews. The Red Roses laundry van watched the front door shut behind James Bond and then moved off at a sedate speed to its garage not far from Scotland Yard while the process of developing the canonflex film went on in its interior.</p> <p>'Appointment with Major Townsend,' said Bond.</p> <p>'Yes. He's expecting you, sir. Shall I take your raincoat?' The powerful-looking doorman put the coat on a coathanger and hung it up on one of a row of hooks beside the door. As soon as Bond was safely doseted with Major Townsend, the coat would go swiftly to the laboratory on the first floor where its provenance would be established from an examination of the fabric. Pocket dust would be removed for more leisurely research. 'Would you follow me, sir?'</p> <p>It was a narrow corridor of freshly painted clapboard with a tall, single window which concealed the Fluoroscope triggered automatically from beneath the ugly patterned carpet. The findings of its X-ray eye would be fed into the laboratory above the passage. The passage ended in two facing doors marked 'A' and 'B'. The doorman knocked on Room B and stood aside for Bond to enter.</p> <p>It was a pleasant, very light room, dose-carpeted in dove-grey Wilton. The military prints on the cream walls were expensively framed. A small, bright fire burned under an Adam mantelpiece which bore a number of silver trophies and two photographs in leather frames - one of a nice-looking woman and the other of three nice-looking children. There was a central table with a bowl of flowers and two comfort-able club chain on either side of the fire. No desk or filing cabinets, nothing official-looking. A tall man, as pleasant as the room, got up from the far chair, dropped The Times on the carpet beside it, and came forward with a welcoming smile. He held out a firm, dry hand.</p> <p>This was the Soft Man.</p> <p>'Come in. Come in. Take a pew. Cigarette? Not the ones I seem to remember you favour. Just the good old Senior Service.'</p> <p>Major Townsend had carefully prepared the loaded remark - a reference to Bond's liking for the Morland Specials with the three gold rings. He noted Bond's apparent lack of comprehension. Bond took a cigarette and accepted a light. They sat down facing one another. Major Townsend crossed his legs comfortably. Bond sat up straight Major Townsend said, 'Well now. How can I help you?'</p> <p>Across the corridor, in Room A, a cold Office-of-Works cube with no furnitu...</p></p><h2>Shadowland</h2><p><b>You have been there...<br>if you have ever been afraid.</b><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Come back.

Here, Trudeau covers the 11-month siege and capture of Petersburg, the gracious southern town that was a rail center, major rebel supply depot, and lifeline to Richmond, capital of the Confederacy. He shows us the great commanders matching wits in a long bloody duel: Grant, the cool, calculating master of logistics, waging a war of attrition against the wily, charismatic Lee, whose outnumbered Army of Northern Virginia usually emerged victorious through brilliant tactics. Trudeau includes a description of the bizarre Battle of the Crater, in which Pennsylvania miners dug a 500-foot tunnel packed with powder under Southern defenses, causing a great explosion and resulting in a fierce battle between major forces. Petersburg was the largest military action ever waged against an American city, greater than the more publicized sieges of Southern citadels like Richmond, Atlanta, and Vicksburg. As usual, Trudeau has done exhaustive research of great sprawling events that at times may overwhelm a general reader. He not only cites formal historical accounts, unit histories, and field reports of officers but adds a needed human dimension, expounding on what war means to soldiers and civilians by consulting diaries, letters, memoirs, and eyewitness reports that bring home the horror and terror of combat. Perhaps the definitive one-volume account of the siege of Petersburg--a great achievement in mastering and interpreting vast material.

All rights reserved.</i>A sequel to Bloody Roads South (which covered the Overland Campaign of May-June 1864), this follows the fighting in Virginia to early April 1865, shortly before Lee's surrender at Appomattox. The nine-month Petersburg campaign was, in the author's view, the South's Gethsemane ("the place where its moral character and its belief in its own righteous cause faced their ultimate testing"). In masterly fashion Trudeau tracks the tactical struggle as Gen. Ulysses S. Grant seeks weak spots in Gen. Robert E. Lee's lines while Lee, forced to spread his smaller army ever more thinly, contests Grant's flanking movements in a series of hard-fought battles. Trudeau also provides vivid glimpses of civilian life inside besieged Petersburg and describes President Lincoln's visits to Grant's headquarters during the siege. The campaign reached its climax with Gen. Philip Sheridan's victory at Five Forks, followed by an assault on the Confederate lines which broke Lee's resistance. This oft-ignored major campaign of the Civil War receives expert examination here.

Burroughs </b>(1914-1997) was an American author, painter, and spoken-word performer who has had a wide-ranging influence on American culture. Jack Kerouac called him the "greatest satirical writer since Jonathan Swift." Norman Mailer declared him "the only American writer who may be conceivably possessed by genius." A postmodernist and a key figure of the beat generation, he focused his art on a relentless subversion of the moral, political, and economic conventions of modern American society, as reflected in his often darkly humorous and sardonic satire. He wrote eighteen novels and novellas, six short-story collections, and four collections of essays. No fewer than five books of his interviews and correspondence have been published. He also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians and made many appearances in films. He was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1983 and in the following year was appointed to the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.</p>The trilogy that began with Cities of the Red Night (1981) and continued with The Place of Dead Roads (1983) is completed here, and the result is a divine comedy. Although this final volume is a significant work on its own merits, one must wade through the chaotic and at times unintelligible Cities and the more coherent though by no means easy Place to fully understand why The Western Lands is a remarkable achievement. While the plot resists encapsulation, in general terms it concerns the search for eternal rest that is symbolized by the Western Lands of Egyptian mythology. Among those involved in the quest are many characters from the earlier books in the trilogy, as well as a few from Naked Lunch; not the least of them is Burroughs himself. While Burroughs's ability to create and describe vast, hellish landscapes has never been denied, often there has been no character with whom the reader can empathize. Here, however, an empathetic bond is established in passages describing the fear of death, where Burroughs speaks more directly than usual, sometimes in the guise of old, forgotten novelist William Seward Hall, sometimes forthrightly and freely in his authorial voice. As a result, Burroughs fans will find this narrative vivid, horrifying, beautiful and sad. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Narrative of John Smith</h2><p><p></p>Before there was the astute detective Sherlock Holmes and his capable compatriot Watson, there was the opinionated Everyman John Smith. In 1883, when he was just twenty-three, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote <i>The Narrative of John Smith</i> while he was living in Portsmouth and struggling to establish himself as both a doctor and a writer. He had already succeeded in having a number of short stories published in leading magazines of the day, such as <i>Blackwood&#x2019;s</i>, <i>All the Year Round</i>, <i>London Society</i>, and the <i>Boy&#x2019;s Own Paper</i>&#x2014;but as was the accepted practice of literary journals of the time, his stories had been published anonymously. Thus, Conan Doyle knew that in order to truly establish his name as a writer, he would have to write a novel. That novel&#x2014;the first he ever wrote and only now published for the first time&#x2014;is <i>The Narrative of John Smith</i>.&nbsp;Many of the themes and stylistic tropes of his later writing, including his first Sherlock Holmes story, <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>&#x2014;published in 1887&#x2014;can be clearly seen. More a series of ruminations than a traditional novel, <i>The Narrative of John Smith</i> is of considerable biographical importance and provides an exceptional window into the mind of the creator of Sherlock Holmes. Through John Smith, a fifty-year-old man confined to his room by an attack of gout, Conan Doyle sets down his thoughts and opinions on a range of subjects&#x2014;including literature, science, religion, war, and education&#x2014;with no detectable insecurity or diffidence. His writing is full of bravado.&nbsp;Though unfinished, <i>The Narrative of John Smith</i> stands as a fascinating record of the early work of a man on his way to being one of the best-known authors in the world. This book will be welcomed with enthusiasm by the numerous Conan Doyle devotees.&nbsp;<p></p></p><p><p>&nbsp;<b>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</b> (1859 &#x2013;1930) was a British physician and writer, most noted for his stories about the detective Sherlock Holmes. He was a prolific writer whose other works include science fiction stories, historical novels, plays, romances, poetry, and nonfiction.</p>&#x201c;One couldn&#x2019;t ask for better scholarship. Lellenberg is the learned and extremely dedicated representative of the Conan Doyle estate in North America (as well as the author of an archival history of the Baker Street Irregulars) and Stashower is a noted biographer whose books include an Edgar Award&#x2013;winning life of Conan Doyle, <i>Teller of Tales</i>.&#x201d; (Michael Dirda <i>New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Someone, I think it was the noted Janeite Lord David Cecil, once said that Jane Austen was the kind of writer on whose laundry lists and notes to the milkman any keen reader would pounce. While Conan Doyle may not be considered to be in quite that category there can be no doubt that the heart of every lover of British writing will rejoice at this discovery of an early and as yet unpublished work by the creator of Holmes, Watson, Moriarty and Professor Challenger. The breadth, depth and scope of Conan Doyle&#x2019;s knowledge and curiosity is often overlooked. He was the first popular writer to tell the wider reading public about narcotics, the Ku Klux Klan, the mafia, the Mormons, American crime gangs, corrupt union bosses and much else besides. His boundless energy, enthusiasm and wide-ranging mind, not to mention the pitch-perfect, muscular and memorable prose is all on display here in a work whose publication is very very welcome indeed.&#x201d; (Stephen Fry)</p><h2>Empire of Capital</h2><p>In this era of globalization, we hear a great deal about a new imperialism and its chief enforcer, the United States. Today, with the US promising an endless war against terrorism and promoting a policy of preemptive defense, this notion seems more plausible than ever. <br><br>But what does imperialism mean in the absence of colonial conquest and direct imperial rule? In this lucid and lively book Ellen Meiksins Wood explores the new imperialism against the contrasting background of older forms, from ancient Rome, through medieval Europe, the Arab Muslim world, the Spanish conquests, and the Dutch commercial empire. Tracing the birth of a capitalist imperialism back to the English domination of Ireland, Wood follows its development through the British Empire in America and India. <br><br>The book brings into sharp relief the nature of today&#x2019;s new capitalist empire, in which the political reach of imperial power cannot match its economic hegemony, and the global economy is administered not by a global state but by a system of multiple local states, policed by the most disproportionately powerful military force the world has ever known and enforced according to a new military doctrine of war without end, in purpose or time.</p><p><b>Ellen Meiksins Wood,</b> for many years Professor of Political Science at York University, Toronto, is the author of many books, including <i>Democracy Against Capitalism </i>and, with Verso, <i>The Pristine Culture of Capitalism, The Origin of Capitalism, Peasant-Citizen and Slave, Citizens to Lords,</i> <i>Empire of Capital </i>and <i>Liberty and Property</i>.Readers who make it past the musty jargon of academic Marxism that announces itself in the introduction will proceed to a thought-provoking genealogy of empires throughout history. Wood, a professor at York University in Toronto and an orthodox economic determinist, argues that the source of an empire's wealth drives its military, administrative and ideological practices. She distinguishes between the Roman "empire of property," a land-based system that stimulated unending territorial conquest; the Arab, Venetian and Dutch "empires of commerce," dedicated to the protection of trade routes and market dominance; and the British "empire of capital," marked by the imposition of market imperatives on conquered territories. The book culminates with a study of what Wood describes as the "new imperialism we call globalization." Challenging those critics of globalization who emphasize the role of corporations and international institutions like the World Bank, Wood says that the capitalist system is more than ever reliant on nation-states to maintain order, with the United States acting as the great imperial enforcer. Wood believes that the inevitable end of a system of universal capitalism is a system of universal war, which is how she sees the new doctrine put forth by the Bush administration in the name of fighting terrorism. Wood's dense analysis would have benefited from more historical evidence and engagement with alternative theories. The connections she draws between economic and imperial systems are intriguing but incomplete explanations of geopolitical dynamics. A worthwhile study for leftist academics, Wood's book is not written to appeal to a broader audience.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Someplace to Be Flying (Newford)</h2><p>Here is Lily, a photojournalist in search of the "animal people" who supposedly haunt the city's darkest slums.

Native Americans call them the First People, but they have never left, and they claim they city for their own.</p><p> Not only have Hank and Lily stumbled onto a secret, they've stumbled into a war.

As fledgling artists in their respective fields, Margaret Atwood and Charles Pachter were enthusiastic collaborators in a unique art form, the livre d'artiste the marriage of original graphic work with literary text. Beginning in the mid-sixties, while both were still students, they worked together on five limited-edition handmade books, volumes of Atwood's poetry with Pachter's interpretive artwork. The culmination of their collaboration, the work that is considered their masterpiece, is <i>The Journals of Susanna Moodie</i>. In her reading of Susanna Moodie's chronicles of pioneer life in nineteenth-century Canada, Atwood found the haunting and timeless themes that still obsess us. The poems of <i>The Journals of Susanna Moodie</i> were first published in 1970 in a standard format. This sequence of poems is regarded as a classic, in addition to being connected with her later novel, Alias Grace. In 1980, Pachter was able to add his own vibrant, evocative images and create the version they had dreamt of: a hand-set, hand-printed illustrated limited edition of 120 numbered copies. This popular edition is a faithful re-creation of the original, accompanied by an introductory memoir by Pachter, describing his friendship with Atwood and the creative process behind this breathtaking work, and a foreword by David Staines, who pays homage to Atwood, Pachter, and Moodie and their central places in our art and literature.</p></p><p>The poetic/artistic exploration of what it means to find yourself thrown into a hostile environment, these poems by Margaret Atwood and silk-screen illustrations by Charles Pachter are based on the journals of Canadian pioneer Susanna Moodie. The setting allows Atwood to write cutting lines about the fundamental tensions in creating and defining a self. One such tension, the assertion of will on the world as well as on one's self, set against the spirit-crushing tribulations of loneliness and hopelessness, is especially electric. <i>The Journals of Susanna Moodie</i> is a beautiful and hypnotic book.Charles Pachter is one of Canada's leading contemporary artists. He is an award-winning painter, printmaker, sculptor, designer, historian, and lecturer. His canvases hang in public and private collections around the world, and in the McMichael Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario, and the Art Gallery of Ontario. He is the author of two children's books, <i>M is for Moose: A Charles Pachter Alphabet</i> (winner of the IODE Book Award, nominated for the Ruth and Sylvia Schwartz Children's Illustrated Book Award and the Canadian Booksellers Association's Libris Award) and <i>Canada Counts: A Charles Pachter Counting Book</i>. He is an Officer of the Order of Canada. He lives in Toronto.<br><br>Margaret Atwood has published 17 books of poetry. Her first poetry book, <i>The Circle Game</i>, was typeset and illustrated by Charles Pachter (Cranbrook Academy of Art, 1964) prior to publication and won the Governor General&#x2019;s Literary Award in 1966.

Joyce is the author of many celebrated cookbooks, including The Mediterranean Kitchen and Back to Square One (winner of the Best Cookbook awards from both the James Beard Foundation and the International Association of Culinary Professionals). Joyce started teaching more than two decades ago at her own California Street Cooking School and she continues to teach home and professional cooks in schools around the country. She lives in San Francisco.Goldstein is that rarity among chefs--a successful restaurant owner (of San Francisco's Square One), food columnist ( San Francisco Chronicle ), and self-taught, self-made cook. And as a mother whose children work with her (how many cooks can say, "my son, the sommelier"?), Goldstein takes a practical approach to working with food. While American ingredients may not create the most authentic Mediterranean fare, she reassures, "We cook this food with the best ingredients available . . . it will be in the spirit of the Mediterranean." Her down-to-earth attitude finds its culinary counterpart in food that is "simple, unpretentious . . . satisfying to eat and not too complicated to prepare." Twelve chapters cover appetizers, salads, soups, pastas, beans, grains, fish, poultry, meats, vegetables and desserts, illustrated by daughter Rachel. Standouts include a simple, refreshing black bean salad with prosciutto and hard-cooked eggs and a mushroom and hazelnut soup.

Just one quick stop at the grocery store and she&#x2019;d be on the way home to cuddle up with her new book in front of a warm fire. </p><p>As she waited at the traffic light to turn into the grocery store lot she took off one glove to feel if the air blasting out of the heat vents was starting to warm. Ah, yes. What a relief. In the few minutes it had taken her to get from her bookstore to the grocery store her fingers had started to ache from the cold. &#x201c;I think I was born with cold fingers,&#x201d; she muttered. The light changed to green and as she turned into the lot she came alongside a narrow median strip and noticed a man holding a crudely made hand-lettered cardboard sign. homeless. need food. please help. At his feet was a small white plastic bucket. His collar was pulled high against the cold, but her eyes went to his hands holding the sign. Bare hands. </p><p>&nbsp; <i>My fingers ache from five minutes in this cold car, with gloves on. How cold must his be? </i>she wondered. Her eyes went to his face. <i>Late twenties, probably six or seven years older than Mark. </i>The sudden thought of her son instantly made her shoulders sag. She hadn&#x2019;t seen Mark since summer. Addicted to drugs, Mark had left home several months ago after a two-year struggle&#x2014;maybe <i>war </i>was a better word&#x2014;with his parents over his drug abuse. He still called sometimes, but he&#x2019;d been bunking with friends, house hopping, and he&#x2019;d even slept on the streets rather than come back home. Never had she felt so helpless as she&#x2019;d felt watch�ing her son self-destruct during these past two years. Never so powerless to meet the deep needs of the son she loved. But he wasn&#x2019;t ready to give up his drugs or his illusion of freedom. He remained elusive about his whereabouts and declined every offer Kate made to meet him someplace to talk. <i>Where is he tonight? Cold and hungry like this guy? Begging on some street corner? And if a kind stranger gives him a ten-dollar bill, he&#x2019;ll buy his next hit of pills before buying a warm meal. </i>Kate&#x2019;s heart sank. <i>Are Mark&#x2019;s hands cold tonight?</i> </p><p>And then it came to her. A quiet nudge. She parked, hurried into the store to pick up bread, eggs, and some yogurt for the week�end, then hit one more aisle. Through the checkout, a dash back to her car, and back along the other side of the median strip, where she pulled alongside the young man, rolled down her window, and stopped. Her heart picked up its pace. He walked over to her car, bucket held out, but she didn&#x2019;t hand any money out the window.&nbsp;Instead she held out a warm pair of gloves she&#x2019;d just bought. He looked startled. &#x201c;Your hands must be terribly cold,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I hope these help.&#x201d; The young man looked confused for a moment, then accepted the gloves. &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; he said. The car behind her honked and she pulled away and moved toward the intersection. She glanced in the rearview mirror and saw him pulling on the gloves. She blinked to clear a few tears away. They were warm on her cold cheeks, but another warmth from somewhere in her core was spreading upward, and she found herself smiling. For the first time in a long time she didn&#x2019;t feel powerless at the thought of Mark. <i>Take care of my son tonight, Lord</i>, she prayed. <i>Show him Your love through the kindness of a stranger. And Lord, comfort the mother of that young man tonight.</i> In that one simple act Kate had discovered the power of gener�osity. She&#x2019;d not only warmed a troubled young man, she&#x2019;d kindled a spark of hope for Mark. And she realized that God had just used her to care for the son of another worried mother. Who knows, maybe the young man on the median strip called his mother that night. Just one simple act. </p><p><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;<i>A Discovery worth Sharing</i> </p><p> </p><p>You&#x2019;ve read the subtitle of this book, <i>Discovering the Power of Gen�erosity. </i>If you recognized my name on the cover of the book you may be asking yourself why a writer known for fiction is writing a nonfiction book on generosity. The answer is . . . well . . . if you don&#x2019;t mind me quoting the title . . . <i>simple. </i>Have you ever discov�ered something so great that you just had to tell your friends?&nbsp;</p><p>You know, like a great little vacation spot you stumbled across while on a trip, or a new clothing store with affordable prices, great selec�tion, and really stellar service? Maybe you&#x2019;ve heard a speaker who had a huge impact on you or saw a movie that made you laugh till you cried and you knew just the friend who needed it. When we find something we love, we want to share it with others and spread the joy. Right? That is how I feel about simple acts of generos�ity. I have had some encounters with generosity&#x2014;as the recipient, the giver, the witness&#x2014;that have had a profoundly life-changing impact on me. I&#x2019;ve just got to share the news. On the other hand, you may have seen the word &#x201c;generosity&#x201d; and thought to yourself, <i>Oh, great. One more appeal to go digging deep into my pocket</i>. Don&#x2019;t worry! You are not in for a brand-new load of guilt, I promise! That&#x2019;s precisely what this book is <i>not </i>about. In our age of overwork and exhaustion, tossing a few dollars here and there may be the easiest way to practice generosity. But I am talking about it in larger terms&#x2014;life-changing terms. Like my friend Kate. She made a five-minute investment of time and on a whim probably spent about eight or nine dollars on that pair of gloves. But her decision had nothing to do with her wallet. It had to do with her heart. When she handed those gloves out the window she brought unexpected goodness into a bleak situation. And that goodness spilled over and gave back. It multiplied. For my friend Kate, that was just the beginning. But that is a story for another time. When you pick up a book, it&#x2019;s fair to ask, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s in it for me?&#x201d; My goal in writing this is to surprise you with the multiple benefits that come from small and large acts of generosity. I&#x2019;m convinced that we cannot become all we could be until we are willing to unclench our hands and release what we&#x2019;ve been clinging to, what we&#x2019;ve been determined to keep for ourselves. The intriguing part is that once we release such gifts we are free to take hold of some�thing more, something better, something that God has wanted to give us for a very long time. </p><p>Simply put, intentional acts of generosity can open our lives to the very best God has to offer. In fact, the very best that God has to offer is exactly where we need to start. </p><p>&nbsp; <i>A Tradition worth Keeping</i> </p><p>Several years ago I read of the old Quaker tradition of keeping a gratitude journal. I was inspired by the idea so I purchased a book with blank pages and titled it <i>My Ode to Joy. </i>Each morning I wrote a little thank-you note to God. I found it to be a way to start my day on a positive note. Little did I understand then how the disci�pline of writing down five things for which I am thankful every day would forever change my life. </p><p>When I first started I found it easy to hit the big things&#x2014;good parents, a wonderful husband, my children (and later my grand�children), and, of course, a writing career I love. These precious gifts still make their way on to my list over and over. Today, when I reread journals from past years I see that as the months, then years trickled by, I began to dig deeper for things to add to my list. As I matured in my understanding of how God works, it wasn&#x2019;t only the good things, the pleasant, &#x201c;happy&#x201d; gifts for which I expressed appreciation. I began to see more clearly how God was using life&#x2019;s trials in unexpected ways for my good, so I began to write down my gratitude for the seemingly negative things in my life&#x2014;my troubles, pains, and losses. With that knowledge I became more confident that God would see me through everything, and my gratitude grew deeper. In fact, the greatest example of giving thanks for negative things can be found in Corrie ten Boom&#x2019;s book <i>The Hiding Place.</i></p><p>During World War II, Corrie and her sister, Betsie, had been ar�rested in Holland for trying to help Jews escape the Holocaust. They ended up in Ravensbr�ck, one of the most infamous Nazi concentration camps. Their barracks had been built to hold 400 prisoners, but by the time the sisters arrived at the camp, the one-room building held more than 1,400 women. Living conditions were insufferable. The women were housed like stacked cordwood on dirty, flea-infested straw strewn on wooden platforms. The fleas feasted night and day until everyone was covered in itchy, raised welts. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for their Bible and the comfort the sisters were able to take from Betsie&#x2019;s readings, Corrie didn&#x2019;t know how they could have survived from day to day. If the guards had ventured into the room they would have discovered the forbidden Bible. Not only would it have been confiscated, but the consequences would have been brutal. Over and over, the two sisters wondered over the mystery of why the guards never inspected their barracks. </p><p>One morning Betsie read the Bible verse in 1 Thessalonians 5:18 that said, &#x201c;Give thanks in all circumstances.&#x201d; She insisted that they put this into practice, feeling certain that giving thanks was the answer to their suffering.

Songs like &#x201c;The Sound of Silence,&#x201d; &#x201c;Bridge Over Troubled Water,&#x201d; &#x201c;Still Crazy After All These Years,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Graceland&#x201d; have moved beyond the sales charts and into our cultural consciousness. But Simon is a deeply private person who has resisted speaking to us outside of his music. He has said he will not write an autobiography or memoir, and he has refused to talk to previous biographers.<br> <br>Finally, Simon has opened up&#x2014;for more than one hundred hours of interviews&#x2014;to Robert Hilburn, whose biography of Johnny Cash was named by Michiko Kakutani of the <i>New York Times</i> as one of her ten favorite books of 2013. The result is a landmark book that will take its place as the defining biography of one of America&#x2019;s greatest artists.<br> <br>It begins in Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, where, raised by a bandleader father and schoolteacher mother, Simon grew up with the twin passions of baseball and music. The latter took over at age twelve when he and schoolboy chum Art Garfunkel became infatuated with the alluring harmonies of doo-wop. Together, they became international icons, and then Simon went on to even greater artistic heights on his own. But beneath the surface of his storied five-decade career is a roller coaster of tumultuous personal and professional ups and downs. From his remarkable early success with Garfunkel to their painfully acrimonious split; from his massive early hits as a solo artist to the wrenching commercial failures of <i>One-Trick Pony</i> and <i>Hearts and Bones</i>; from the historic comeback success of <i>Graceland</i> and <i>The Rhythm of the Saints</i> to the star-crossed foray into theater with <i>The Capeman</i> and a late-career creative resurgence&#x2014;his is a musical life unlike any other.<br> <br>Over the past three years, Hilburn has conducted in-depth interviews with scores of Paul Simon&#x2019;s friends, family, colleagues, and others&#x2014;including ex-wives Carrie Fisher and Peggy Harper, who spoke for the first time&#x2014;and even penetrated the inner circle of Simon&#x2019;s long-reclusive muse, Kathy Chitty. The result is a deeply human account of the challenges and sacrifices of a life in music at the highest level. In the process, Hilburn documents Simon&#x2019;s search for artistry and his constant struggle to protect that artistry against distractions&#x2014;fame, marriage, divorce, drugs, record company interference, rejection, and insecurity&#x2014;that have derailed so many great pop figures.<br> <br><i>Paul Simon</i> is an intimate and inspiring narrative that helps us finally understand Paul Simon the person and the artist. &#x201c;With train-wreck moments and tender interludes alike, it delivers a sharply detailed Kodachrome of a brilliant musician&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>).</p><p>Robert Hilburn was the chief pop music critic for the <i>Los Angeles Times </i>for more than three decades. Author of the bestselling biography <i>Johnny Cash: The Life</i>, which Michiko Kakutani of the <i>New York Times </i>selected as one of her top ten books of 2013, Hilburn has reported extensively on most of pop music&#x2019;s giants, including Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen, Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen and U2. He lives in Los Angeles.&nbsp;Paul Simon PROLOGUE<p></p> <br>Ever since his debut on Saturday Night Live in 1975, Paul Simon looked forward to walking the narrow hallway to the stage at NBC Studios in Midtown Manhattan. Whether alone, or with Art Garfunkel, or with the high-stepping, show-stopping South African vocal group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, he enjoyed the well-wishes of the cast and crew as he made the walk&#x2014;their smiles, shouts of encouragement, and even pats on the back.<br> <br>This time&#x2014;the night of September 29, 2001&#x2014;it was different.<br> <br>As soon as Simon stepped into the hallway, he saw a row of New York City firefighters and police officers, their heads bowed, still mourning the deaths of more than four hundred of their comrades in the World Trade Center terrorist assault eighteen days before. It made Simon wonder whether this tribute to the victims of the 9/11 attacks&#x2014;some nine thousand killed or wounded&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t premature. Many in the SNL cast of comedians asked themselves the same question. Would people really be ready for jokes?<br> <br>Simon had already joined nearly two dozen musicians&#x2014;including Bruce Springsteen and U2&#x2014;in performing on a September 21 telethon that was broadcast around the world and raised more than $200 million for families of the victims. In one of the show&#x2019;s emotional highlights, he sang his most famous composition, the gospel-edged &#x201c;Bridge Over Troubled Water.&#x201d; But that night wasn&#x2019;t quite the same. The telethon was designed as a worldwide expression of solidarity and support. Artists performed on candlelit stages with no studio audiences, giving the event an intimacy that was somber and inspiring.<br> <br>For SNL, Lorne Michaels, the creator of the culture-defining series, wanted to aim directly and unmistakably at the residents of New York City&#x2014;opening with Mayor Rudy Giuliani standing with some thirty fire and police personnel who had just come off duty at ground zero, the dust of the site still visible on their uniforms. The plan was for the mayor to say a few words about the glory and resilience of New York and then have Simon sing a song, which would serve as a crucial step in Michaels&#x2019;s goal of lifting the city&#x2019;s spirits.<br> <br>Michaels believed Simon was the perfect choice&#x2014;the only choice. He was one of the all-time great American songwriters, inducted into both the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame (twice) and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the only artist to receive Album of the Year Grammy Awards for records made in three separate decades. His tunes had been recorded by a treasure chest of vocalists, from Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra to Barbra Streisand and Ray Charles.<br> <br>Simon was also a New Yorker whose career reflected the triumphs and struggles of the city itself. He had come out of the borough of Queens with his schoolboy chum Art Garfunkel to enjoy superstar status around the world, and then exhibited the guts to walk away from the duo at the height of its popularity in 1970 to follow his own musical dreams. The first solo decade proved to be an even more creative period for him than the 1960s, thanks to his wider musical range, and the 1980s were equally commanding, including his masterpiece, Graceland. At the same time, Simon had felt the sting of defeat. He&#x2019;d never been forgiven by a lot of Simon and Garfunkel fans for breaking up the partnership. He had also gone through two divorces and had failed in his ventures into movies (One-Trick Pony) and Broadway (The Capeman).<br> <br>To Michaels, Simon had one other vital link to this special evening: he had been in the city on 9/11, and he knew the fear that gripped it. On that morning, he had walked two of his children&#x2014;Adrian, eight, and Lulu, six&#x2014;to school, about fifteen minutes along Central Park West. It was a lovely day with just a trace of prefall chill in the air. By the time he returned to his apartment just after nine o&#x2019;clock, his wife, Edie Brickell, was at the door with the news that an American Airlines plane had crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.<br> <br>As Simon stared at the television screen, his first thought was that it was a tragic accident&#x2014;only to watch in horror as a second plane, this one from United Airlines, smashed into the South Tower. There was now no question that the city was under attack. In panic, he raced back to the school to bring home Adrian, Lulu, and the children of some of his friends. To keep the kids calm, Paul and Edie turned off the television so they could play without hearing the frightful details of what was happening downtown, just a few subway stops away.<br> <br>President George W. Bush soon confirmed the attack, and city officials closed the bridges and tunnels leading into and out of the city. Within minutes, a plane attacked the western fa�ade of the Pentagon, and yet another crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. By the end of the day, there was a strange smell in the air in New York&#x2014;not a normal smoke smell but all the chemicals from the crashes. &#x201c;It was like we were all trapped, all helpless,&#x201d; Simon said. &#x201c;You wanted to help, but what could you do?&#x201d; Days later, he got his answer with requests to perform on the two broadcasts.<br> <br>Even with his concern about the timing of Saturday Night Live, there was no way Simon would turn down Michaels, who was one of his closest friends and whose judgment he trusted implicitly. Plus, Simon had been around the SNL set so much that he was like an honorary member of the cast. Still, it was daunting. As soon as he stepped into the hallway, he began to worry about maintaining his composure. Simon had sung at funerals and memorial services for friends and musicians, and he knew how difficult it was to look at grieving faces.<br> <br>Giuliani, as solemn as the fire department and law enforcement officers at his side, opened the show with a statement about the city&#x2019;s resolve: &#x201c;Our hearts are broken, but they are beating, and they are beating stronger than ever. New Yorkers are unified. We will not yield to terrorism. We will not let our decisions be made out of fear. We choose to live our lives in freedom.&#x201d;<br> <br>As he finished, the TV audience heard a few gentle guitar notes, and the camera slowly panned from the mayor to Simon. Dressed in black and wearing an FDNY cap, Simon stood in front of a huge American flag as he began singing the song Michaels had chosen for him: not &#x201c;Bridge Over Troubled Water&#x201d; but &#x201c;The Boxer,&#x201d; a story of Simon&#x2019;s own struggle and resilience, complete with New York City references.<br> <br>Though recorded more than thirty years earlier when Simon was just twenty-seven, &#x201c;The Boxer&#x201d; was a song of remarkable craft and depth, its early verses written in the first person, but its final verse shifting dramatically to the third person to add a compelling ring of universality. That final verse:<br> <br>In the clearing stands a boxer<br> <br>And a fighter by his trade<br> <br>And he carries the reminders<br> <br>Of every glove that laid him down<br> <br>And cut him till he cried out<br> <br>In his anger and his shame<br> <br>&#x201c;I am leaving, I am leaving&#x201d;<br> <br>But the fighter still remains<br> <br>Lie-la-lie . . .<br> <br>The audience remained silent during the first two choruses, giving the moment an added poignancy. As Simon ended that final verse, however, scattered members of the audience whispered the &#x201c;Lie-la-lie&#x201d; chorus with him, adding to the emotion in the studio. Fifteen years later, Lorne Michaels called Simon&#x2019;s performance the most moving musical moment in the history of Saturday Night Live.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was so proud of Paul and the show and the city,&#x201d; he said, acknowledging his own tears that night. &#x201c;The strength he showed with that song&#x2014;standing in front of those firefighters and law enforcement officers and knowing what they had gone through, what the city had gone through&#x2014;was just incredible. Even after all this time, I think he&#x2019;s the only one who could have done it. He is as much a symbol of the show and of New York as there is.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was a defining moment for Simon because it underscored what had long been one of his quintessential qualities as a songwriter. Like &#x201c;The Boxer,&#x201d; so many of his songs moved past any inherent darkness to express consolation, optimism, and even faith. In a rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll world forged by rebellion, his music&#x2014;from &#x201c;America&#x201d; and &#x201c;Mrs. Robinson&#x201d; to &#x201c;American Tune&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Boy in the Bubble&#x201d;&#x2014;was founded on empathy.<br> <br>Despite melancholy and self-doubt at points in his personal life, he avoided despair or hostility in his songs. &#x201c;If all I have to say is how disappointed I am about whatever there is in life, then I don&#x2019;t see what the contribution is,&#x201d; Simon said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s already plenty of that out there. I really don&#x2019;t believe philosophically that&#x2019;s my job. But I&#x2019;m not lying when I go the other way. Love is amazing, and like I say on the You&#x2019;re the One album, it&#x2019;s something you want so desperately that it can make you laugh out loud when you get it. It&#x2019;s like medicine for us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Indeed, Simon&#x2019;s first great song was born during a period of trauma when he was in need of comfort himself. After years of toiling at the lower levels of the music business trying to write teen pop hits largely by copying what was on the radio, he felt in the fall of 1963 that he was at a dead end. Inspired by the emergence of the folk movement in New York&#x2019;s Greenwich Village, he vowed to reach inside to find out if he truly had anything of his own to say in a song. If he was going to be a failure as a songwriter, he told himself, he was going to be a proud failure.<br> <br>As he often did, Simon took his acoustic guitar into the family bathroom, where the tile made the sound all the more alluring, and he turned off the lights so that he could relax and feel totally at one with the music. &#x201c;Ever since I was thirteen or fourteen, songwriting has always been a great place of security and comfort,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Songwriting never turned around and stabbed me in the back. I remember times when I was really sad, and I&#x2019;d sit and play an E chord for a half hour. I wasn&#x2019;t writing a song. I was just comforting myself with this instrument I loved.&#x201d;<br> <br>Night after night in November, he sat in the bathroom with his guitar, alone with his music and his future. Then his world changed with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Simon, who&#x2019;d just turned twenty-two, was on his lunch break from his job at a publishing company in Manhattan when he heard the news. His mother, Belle, remembered that he spent hours despondent in his bedroom.<br> <br>Not long after the tragedy, Simon returned to the bathroom, switched off the lights per his custom, and started softly fingerpicking on the guitar. It was around then that he hit some warmly evocative notes that he played over and over again. Slowly, he began reflecting on thoughts that had been nagging at him for months: the way people ignored the words of those, from musicians to religious leaders, who preached against injustice and excess materialism.<br> <br>As he sat alone, these words eventually burst forth: &#x201c;Hello darkness, my old friend.&#x201d;<br> <br>For the next five-plus decades, Simon wrote with such ambition and craft that it looked easy from a distance. He&#x2019;d deliver a prized album, tour, and then largely disappear for the three or four years it took to write and record another collection. Through it all, he rarely shared his personal story in interviews or engaged in the tabloid-ish episodes that contribute to many artists&#x2019; personas, which rival their music in the public eye. Yet Simon, too, had to deal with the struggles and challenges of a life in the pop world. He wasn&#x2019;t a born songwriter. He spent six years writing one mediocre song after another until, through a series of pinpointable events, he finally became the artist who wrote &#x201c;The Sound of Silence.&#x201d; This evolution makes Simon an ideal case study of pop music excellence and longevity&#x2014;how true artistry is achieved and how you then need to protect it against distractions such as fame, wealth, drugs, marriage, divorce, ego, rejection, changes in public taste, and fear of failure. Simon wasn&#x2019;t immune to any of them.</p><h2>My View from the Corner: A Life in Boxing</h2><p><p>"Dundee is one of the greatest innovators in the annals of the sweet science...guiding world champions as diverse in gladiatorial gifts and mind-sets as Carmen Basilio, Willie Pastrano, Luis Rodriguez, Sugar Ray Leonard, George Foreman (in his comeback) and, of course, Muhammad Ali...Bert Randolph Sugar has superbly captured Dundee&#x2019;s unique diction...by the end the reader will know precisely what it is like to listen to the Bill Walsh of boxing hold court on the exotic art of the cornerman.&#x201d;--<i>The New York Times</i></p> <p>Angelo Dundee has lived a half-century of boxing history.

Meanwhile in Rome, Romulus' twin sister Fabiola lives in fear for her life, loved by Brutus, but wooed by Marcus Antonius, his deadly enemy. Back in Egypt, Romulus fights at Zela, the vicious battle where Caesar famously said, 'Veni, vidi, vici'. Tarquinius, separated from Romulus in the chaos of war, hides in Alexandria, searching for guidance. But mortal danger awaits them both. From the battlefields of North Africa and Spain, to the lawless streets of Rome and the gladiator arena, they face death daily, until on the Ides of March, the twins are reunited and must decide either to back or to betray Caesar on his day of destiny.</p><p>BEN KANE was born in Kenya and raised there and in Ireland.

"Caesar needs us!"</p><p>His squad of ten men needed little encouragement. Their night picket was positioned on the Heptastadion, the narrow, man-made causeway that ran from the docks to a long, thin island, separating the harbor into two parts. With water on both sides, it was an isolated position. Given what was happening, that was not a healthy place to be.</p><p>The yellow glow from the Pharos, the city's huge lighthouse, had been greatly augmented by the burning ships along the quay. Started by Caesar's men, the fire on the vessels had spread fast, reaching out to the nearby warehouses and library buildings to form a conflagration that lit up the scene as bright as day. After regrouping with their comrades who had been driven back into the darkened side streets, thousands of Egyptian troops were re-emerging to slam into Caesar's lines. These were less than a hundred paces away from the Heptastadion, the natural point to hold against an enemy.</p><p>Romulus and Tarquinius ran willingly alongside the legionaries. If the screaming mass of Egyptian soldiers broke through their lines, they would all be killed. Even if the Egyptians didn't succeed initially, the odds of surviving were poor. The legionaries were vastly outnumbered, and had no secure avenue of retreat. The whole city was swarming with unfriendly natives, and the causeway led to an island from which there was no escape. There were only the Roman ships, but thanks to the swarming enemy troops, embarking safely was not possible.</p><p>Grimacing, Romulus threw a longing glance at the one trireme that had got away. It was nearing the western harbor entrance, with Fabiola, his twin sister, on board. After nigh on nine years of separation, they had glimpsed each other a few moments previously. Fabiola was headed out to sea, escaping the danger, and there was nothing Romulus could do about it. Oddly, he was not devastated. He recognized why. Just knowing that Fabiola was alive, and safe, made his heart thrum with an unquenchable joy. With Mithras' help, she would have heard him yell that he was in the Twenty-Eighth Legion, and could thus find him one day. After all his prayers about his long-lost sister, the gods had answered.</p><p>Now, though, as so often before, he was about to fight for his life.</p><p>Press-ganged into the legions, he and Tarquinius were part of Caesar's small task force in Alexandria: a force under imminent threat of being overwhelmed. Romulus took some solace from his new and precarious position, however. If Elysium was waiting for him, then he would not enter it as a slave, nor a gladiator. Not as a mercenary, and not as a captive. Romulus squared his shoulders.</p><p>No, he thought fiercely, I am a Roman legionary. At last. My fate is my own, and Tarquinius will no longer control me. Not an hour past, his blond-haired friend had revealed that he was responsible for the killing which had originally forced Romulus to flee Rome. The shock of it was still sweeping through Romulus. Disbelief, anger and hurt swirled together in a toxic mix that made his head spin. He shoved the pain away, burying it for another time.</p><p>Breathing heavily, the group reached the back of Caesar's formation, which was only six ranks deep. Shouted orders, the metallic clash of arms and the screams of the wounded were suddenly very close. The optio conferred with the nearest officer, a nervous-looking tesserarius. Wearing a transverse-crested helmet and scale armor similar to the optio's, he bore a long staff to keep the legionaries in line. While he and other subordinates stayed at the rear to prevent anyone retreating, the centurions would be at, or near, the front. In a battle as desperate as this, these veteran career soldiers stiffened the resolve of all.</p><p>At length the optio turned to his men. "Our cohort is right here."</p><p>"Trust our luck," muttered one soldier. "Right in the middle of the damn line."</p><p>The optio smiled thinly in acknowledgment. This was where most casualties would fall. "You've got it easy for the moment. Be grateful," he said. "Spread out, two deep. Reinforce this century."</p><p>Grumbling, they did as he said.</p><p>With four others, Romulus and Tarquinius found themselves at the front of their two small files. They did not protest at this. As the new recruits, it was to be expected. Romulus was taller than most, and could see over men's heads and past the upright horsehair crests on their bronze-bowl helmets. Here and there a century standard jutted up into the air, and over on the right flank was the silver eagle, the emotive talisman of the legion. His heart raced at the sight of it, the greatest symbol of Rome, and one that he had grown to love dearly. More than anything, the eagle had helped Romulus to remember that he was a Roman. Imperious, proud and aloof, it cared nothing for men's status, recognizing only their bravery and valor in battle.</p><p>Beyond it, though, was a sea of snarling faces and glinting weapons, sweeping toward them in great rolling waves.</p><p>"They're carrying scuta," Romulus cried in confusion. "Are they Roman?"</p><p>"Once," spat the legionary to his left. "But the bastards have gone native."</p><p>"Gabinius' men then, I would say," said Tarquinius, receiving a gruff nod in response. There were curious stares, especially from those who could see the left side of his face. A prolonged torture session by Vahram, the primus pilus of the Forgotten Legion, had left a shiny red cicatrice on the haruspex' cheek in the shape of a knife blade.</p><p>Thanks to Tarquinius, Romulus was familiar with the story of Ptolemy XII, the father of the current rulers of Egypt, who had been deposed more than a decade before. Desperate, Ptolemy had turned to Rome, offering incredible sums in gold to restore him to the throne. Eventually, Gabinius, the proconsul of Syria, seized the opportunity. That had been at the same time that Romulus, Brennus, his Gaulish friend, and Tarquinius were traveling in Crassus' army.</p><p>"Aye," muttered the legionary. "They stayed here after Gabinius returned in disgrace to Rome."</p><p>"How many are left?" asked Romulus.</p><p>"A few thousand," came the answer. "But they've got plenty of help. Nubian skirmishers and Judaean mercenaries mostly, and Cretan slingers and archers. All tough bastards."</p><p>"There are infantry as well," said another man. "Escaped slaves from our provinces."</p><p>An angry growl met his words.</p><p>Romulus and Tarquinius exchanged a look. It was imperative their status, particularly that of Romulus, remained secret. Slaves were not allowed to fight in the regular army. To join the legions, which Romulus' press-ganging had effectively done for him, carried the death penalty.</p><p>"Those treacherous whoresons won't stand against us," the first legionary proclaimed. "We'll knock seven shades of shit out of them."</p><p>It was the right thing to say. Pleased grins cracked across worried faces.</p><p>Romulus held back his instinctive retort. Spartacus' followers, slaves all, had bettered the legions on numerous occasions. He himself was the match of any three ordinary legionaries. With a new homeland to defend, the enemy slaves could prove tough to defeat. This was not the time, nor the place, to mention such matters, though. When was? Romulus wondered with a tinge of bitterness. Never.</p><p>With ready weapons, they waited as the clash became more desperate. Showers of enemy javelins and stones flew into their lines, cutting down men here and there. Lacking shields, Romulus and Tarquinius could only duck down and pray as death whistled overhead. It was most disconcerting. As the casualties grew heavier, spare equipment became available. A stocky soldier in the rank ahead went down with a spear through the neck. Quickly Romulus pulled off the twitching man's helmet, feeling little remorse. The needs of the living were greater than those of the dead. Even the sweat-soaked felt liner that he jammed on his head first felt like some kind of protection. Tarquinius took the corpse's scutum, and it wasn't long before Romulus had his own one too, from another victim.</p><p>The optio grunted in approval. The two ragged wanderers did not just possess good weapons, they also knew their way around military equipment.</p><p>"This is more like it," said Romulus, lifting his elongated oval shield by its horizontal grip. Not since the Forgotten Legion's last battle four years before had they both been fully equipped. He scowled. It was still hard not to feel guilty about Brennus, who had died so that he and Tarquinius might escape.</p><p>"Seen combat before?" demanded the legionary.</p><p>Before Romulus could reply, a shield boss hit him in the back.</p><p>"Forward!" shouted the optio, who had shoved in behind them. "The line in front is weakening."</p><p>Pushing against the rows in front, they shuffled toward the enemy. Dozens of gladii, the Roman short stabbing swords, were raised in preparation. Shields were lifted until the only part of men's faces that could be seen was their flickering eyes under their helmet rims. They moved shoulder to shoulder, each protected by his comrades. Tarquinius was to Romulus' right and the talkative legionary was on his left. Both were responsible for his safety as he was for theirs. It was one of the beauties of the shield wall. Although Romulus was furious with Tarquinius, he did not think that the haruspex would fail in this duty.</p><p>He had not appreciated how thin their ranks had become. Suddenly the soldier in front slumped to his knees, and a screaming enemy warrior jumped into the gap, taking Romulus by surprise. He was wearing a blunt-peaked Phrygian helmet and a rough-spun tunic, with no armor. An oval spined shield and a rhomphaia, a strange sword with a long, curved blade, were his only weapons. This was a Thracian peltast, Romulus thought, shocked twice over.</p><p>Without thinking, he jumped forward, smashing his scutum boss at the other's face. The move failed as the Thr...</p></p><h2>Suddenly Senior: The Funny Thing About Getting Older</h2><p><br>'You know you're getting old when you can pinch an inch on your forehead.'

Fed by rain and melted snow, rivulets of cold, clear water gush over boulders and between rocky ridges to lace the mountainsides. Thousands of miles of freestone streams run unchecked, cascading down to form the mighty rivers. </p><p> Mia Landan followed the river as it wound in a serpentine manner, deeper into the woods. To her right, the sienna-hued wall of rock was dotted with patches of bright green moss. To her left, the river raced on, rushing forward in a confident current. She reached over the passenger seat of her car to clutch a wrinkled sheet of paper from under a torn road map. Scribbled across the page of directions she read, <i>Follow the river</i>. </p><p> "I am not lost," she said aloud, though she doubted her words. She was following the pebbles in the river like Hansel and Gretel, believing that they would lead her through the dark forest to a safe haven. Except Mia Landan no longer believed in fairy tales. </p><p> Thunder rolled overhead, threatening rain. Back home in Charleston, South Carolina, the spring rain had already given way to scorching heat and humidity. Here in the North Carolina mountains, however, the air was still cool and the forests aflame with wildflowers. Around each bend in the road she encountered a cluster of rhododendrons blooming scarlet or white. A little farther on, the paved road ended to become a rutted bed of dirt and gravel, as worn and filled with holes as a pauper's coat. </p><p> A few fat drops of rain splattered against the windshield, turning the dust to long streaks of mud. She turned on the windshield wipers and her heartbeat matched the metronome click. She leaned far over the wheel, clutching it tight, peering through the sudden deluge at the sliver of road ahead. Where was the cabin? she worried as she peered through the rain and fog. Could it be this far off the beaten track? Just when she thought she should turn around and head back, the river tumbled over a ridge of rocks to a large pool. Beside it on a high bank, nestled between a pair of towering hemlocks, sat a rustic log cabin. </p><p> Mia released a ragged sigh, slumped her shoulders, and loosened her grip on the wheel. She had found it. It had been a long, circuitous drive with directions scribbled in haste. But she'd made it. Her wheels hit soft grass and mud as she parked as close to the cabin as she could. </p><p> Turning off the engine, she was immediately immersed in a deep mountain silence. The miles still raced in her veins. Her clothes clung and the car seat was littered with empty water bottles and candy wrappers. The stale air reminded her of hospital rooms. She lowered the window enough to let the fresh air awaken her after the long journey. The rain sprinkled in and she lifted her face to it, tasting its cool sweetness. </p><p> Mia looked again to the cabin. It lurked, isolated and foreboding, under the canopy of the trees and mist. The woods seemed to close in around her. She felt a shiver of loneliness. But hadn't she wanted a faraway, secluded place? A sanctuary? Rolling up the window she cast a worried glance at the clock on the dashboard. It was half past six. Belle had told her she would pick up supplies and meet her at the cabin no later than seven. There was nowhere to go. The cabin was locked and the rain was coming down in sheets. She was trapped in this car, in the wilderness, to wait as the night closed in around her. Relentless rain coursed tracks down her foggy window, mirroring the tears flowing down her cheeks. Mia brought her hands to her face and wondered how she got to this place. </p><p> It had all begun with fly-fishing. She'd never had any interest in the sport. She was a public relations director for the Spoleto arts festival in Charleston. Though she lived by the ocean and mountains, she didn't have any connection to either. Her idea of a good time was drinks and dinner at a restaurant with friends. If she went on a boat, it was docked for a party. A trip to the mountains meant a few days at a ski lodge. Nonetheless, her sister, Madeline, had signed her up for a three-day fly-fishing retreat designed especially for breast cancer survivors. Casting for Recovery provided spiritual and physical therapy, and Madeline believed Mia needed both. </p><p> So that spring Mia had driven hours from her home in Charleston to the Casting for Recovery retreat in the foothills of North Carolina. She'd agreed to go only to keep Madeline from nagging. Some of the women at the retreat were still early in their treatments. Others were ten, twenty, or more years post-diagnosis. At thirtyeight years old, Mia was the youngest. She was reticent at first, but Belle would not allow her to remain aloof. </p><p> Belle Carson was their fly-fishing guide and the leader of the retreat. Belle was a tall, straight-talking, sensitive, and big-hearted woman who had chucked an academic career at the University of Virginia to move to Asheville, North Carolina, and open her own fly-fishing business. Belle gently coaxed Mia out of isolation into group discussions and taught her how to cast a dry fly. Mia was drawn into the group by force of the women's brutal honesty and their wise understanding. It was an intense three days that felt like three weeks, so much had transpired. They laughed, they cried. They were sister survivors. By the end of the retreat she'd joined their feminine solidarity formed by a shared history. </p><p> But it was in the river that Mia felt the first glimmer of life since the shock of her diagnosis had left her heart as numb as the white scar on her chest. Belle Carson had taught her how to cast a thin line from a rod onto the shallow waters of the Davidson River. To her amazement, she found hope rising in thin wisps of speckled silver. She might not have believed in fairy tales, but she believed in that spark of life she felt at the other end of the line. </p><p> Eager to share her new excitement with her husband, she'd hugged the women farewell and drove back a day early to Charleston. Closing her eyes, Mia saw again the lurid image of her husband and that unknown woman lying on her marriage bed. She'd stumbled down the stairs, climbed back into her car, and started to drive, her eyes blind and her mind numb. </p><p> Mia Landan of two years ago would have stood her ground and confronted them. Then, she was confident in her career, her beauty, her self. <i>That</i> Mia would not have run to the mountains with her tail between her legs. But two years ago Mia had not yet found the lump in her breast. </p><p> The wheels had hummed beneath her on the highway. The green road signs passed in a blur as she put miles between herself and her husband's infidelity. She'd driven for forty-five minutes before she realized she didn't know where she was. When at last she focused on the signs she saw she was on Interstate 26. Her instincts were acting as her compass, guiding her north, back to the mountains where she'd felt safe. </p><p> By the time she'd returned to the retreat, the sun had lowered far to the west and the placid water of the lake had darkened to a deep purple. A few dimples disturbed the glassiness. <i>Rises</i>, she'd learned they were called, were created by trout when they rose to the surface to sip an insect. She drove past the wall of tall firs and hemlocks that surrounded the lake to the row of cottages that she'd shared with the eighteen other women at the retreat. Now they all stood empty and quiet. One by one, each woman had returned to a husband, a family, a partner. For them, life had gone on post-cancer. At that moment, Mia saw with clarity that she was not a survivor. </p><p> She couldn't go back to Charleston. She could not start the engine and drive. She had nothing and no one waiting for her. She'd brought her trembling hands to her face and began to sob. </p><p> Perhaps if she hadn't felt such hope on the river, she could have maintained the hard shell of apathy that had sustained her for the year of treatment and recovery. But the spirit of the river, the rhythm of the cast, and the tenuous connection to life at the end of a thin line had broken through her shell. It had filled her with silvery light, lifted her up and made her feel whole again. To lose that now... </p><p> Belle Carson had been walking down the road and saw Mia crying the hoarse, ragged sobs of a desperate woman. She opened the car door. </p><p> "Mia? What are you doing here? Are you all right?" </p><p> Mia swung around, lifting her face. "I can't go back," she cried in a broken voice. </p><p> Belle leaned over, her long braid slipping over her shoulder, and asked more urgently, "What happened?" </p><p> "He's left me. I have nowhere to go." </p><p> Belle took Mia's arm, then gently but firmly drew her from the car. "Come with me," she said, putting her arm around Mia's shoulders. She guided her inside the lodge which, mercifully, was deserted. Belle treated Mia like she would an injured animal, gently and with a calm voice, giving her time to settle until the panic faded from her eyes. She offered Mia coffee, then rummaged through the camp fridge to prepare a plate and set it before her. When Mia sat slump-shouldered and looked at the food with a dazed expression, Belle didn't nag at her to eat it. She'd sat across from Mia and waited while the sun lowered and the geese honked by the lake, calling their young. When the grief trickled out, Belle handed her tissues, and later, when it gushed, she listened patiently before asking questions. </p><p> It was Belle's dark brown eyes that Mia remembered more than anything she'd actually said. They were calm waters, like the lake, and in their depths she'd felt hope rising. </p><p> Then Belle offered Mia what she needed most -- safe refuge. </p><p> "I have a place," Belle told her. "A cabin not too far away. It's not much. It's been abandoned for years and I haven't checked on it in months. But it's yours, if you want to s...</p></p><h2>Topaz</h2><p>A Perilous Pursuit<p></p><p>Kate Love is an ambitious young newspaper reporter on the trail of a railroad stock swindler who has been preying onelderly Blacks.

The doctors told his mother, Joyce, that his low weight could mean that he might have to be placed in an incubator, but he soon started to feed, and mother and baby returned home to the crowded family home at 43 Shifford Path, Wynell Road, Forest Hill. Although Joyce and Ron, in the words of their son Tony, &#x201c;always said that he [Lee] was the only one they tried for,&#x201d; the birth of the youngest of their six children did nothing to soothe the tense atmosphere in the McQueen household.<br> <br>&#x201c;My dad had a breakdown in 1969, just as my mum gave birth,&#x201d; said Lee&#x2019;s brother Michael McQueen. &#x201c;He was working too hard, a lot of hours as a lorry driver with six children, too many really.&#x201d;1 His brother Tony, who was fourteen years old at the time, remembers noticing that one day his father went unnaturally quiet. &#x201c;He was working seven days a week, he was hardly ever home,&#x201d; said Tony. &#x201c;My mum got someone round and they institutionalized him. It was a difficult period for us.&#x201d; Joyce, in an unpublished manuscript she compiled for the family, noted that her husband spent only three weeks in Cane Hill Hospital, Coulsdon, but according to Tony, &#x201c;Dad had a nervous breakdown and he went into a mental institution for two years.&#x201d;2<br> <br>Cane Hill Hospital was the archetypal Victorian asylum, an enormous rambling madhouse of the popular imagination. Designed by Charles Henry Howell, it was originally known as the Third Surrey County Pauper Lunatic Asylum, so called because the county&#x2019;s other two institutions, Springfield and Brookwood, had reached full capacity. &#x201c;Cane Hill was typical of its time, providing specialized wards for different categories of patients, with day rooms on the ground floor and dormitories and individual cells mostly on the second and third floors,&#x201d; wrote one historian. &#x201c;Difficult patients were confined to cells and those of a more clement disposition could walk the airing grounds&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. By the 1960s, the hospital had changed little.&#x201d;3 Former patients included Charlie Chaplin&#x2019;s mother, Hannah, and the half brothers of both Michael Caine and David Bowie, who used a drawing of the administration block on the American cover of his 1970 album The Man Who Sold the World.<br> <br>Lee McQueen was fascinated by the idea of the asylum&#x2014;he featured the iconography of the madhouse in a number of his collections, particularly Voss (Spring/Summer 2001)&#x2014;and he would have been intrigued by the rumors about a subterranean network of tunnels near Cane Hill. Over the years it has been suggested that the series of brick-lined tunnels housed a mortuary, a secret medical testing facility and a nuclear bomb shelter. Although the truth was much more mundane&#x2014;the tunnels were built as bomb shelters during the Second World War and then taken over by a company that manufactured telescopes&#x2014;the network of underground chambers &#x201c;became somehow connected with the institution and the obscure rusting of machinery took on sinister new overtones, driven by the superstition surrounding the complex.&#x201d;4<br> <br>Years after the closure of Cane Hill, a couple were walking around the grounds of the hospital when, in the Garden House, they came across a bundle of faded yellow pages, remnants of the kind of questionnaire Ronald McQueen would have encountered while a patient at the institution. Many of the fifty-one questions, which patients were encouraged to answer with a response of &#x201c;true&#x201d; or &#x201c;false,&#x201d; would have had a particular resonance if they had later been applied to Lee: &#x201c;I have not lived the right kind of life,&#x201d; &#x201c;Sometimes I feel as if I must injure myself or someone else,&#x201d; &#x201c;I get angry sometimes,&#x201d; &#x201c;Often I think I can&#x2019;t understand why I have been so cross and grouchy,&#x201d; &#x201c;I have sometimes felt that difficulties were piling up so high that I could not overcome them,&#x201d; &#x201c;Someone has it in for me,&#x201d; &#x201c;It is safer to trust nobody,&#x201d; and &#x201c;At times I have a strong urge to do something harmful or shocking.&#x201d;5<br> <br>It&#x2019;s difficult to know the exact effect of Ronald&#x2019;s breakdown on his youngest son. A psychotherapist might be able to draw links between Lee&#x2019;s later mental health issues and his father&#x2019;s illness. Did Lee come to associate his birth, his very existence, with madness? Did the boy feel some level of unconscious guilt for driving his father into a psychiatric ward? There is no doubt, however, that in an effort to comfort both her infant son and herself, Joyce lavished increased levels of love on Lee and, as a result, the bond between them intensified. As a little boy, Lee had a beautiful blond head of curls, and photographs taken at the time show him to be an angelic-looking child. &#x201c;He had preferential treatment from my mother but not my dad; he was a bit Neanderthal because of his hard upbringing,&#x201d; said Michael McQueen.6<br> <br>When Lee was less than a year old the family moved from south London to a council house in Stratford, a district close to the dock area of east London. &#x201c;I think if you&#x2019;re from the East End you can&#x2019;t get used to the south side,&#x201d; said Lee&#x2019;s sister Janet McQueen. &#x201c;They say you can&#x2019;t move an old tree and it was like that. I think it was probably that a housing initiative came up and we had the chance of moving into a house, a new house.&#x201d;7 The council house, at 11 Biggerstaff Road, was a three-story brick terraced house and although it had four bedrooms it was still a squeeze for the family. &#x201c;We boys slept three to a bed in there,&#x201d; said Tony McQueen. &#x201c;My mum would say, &#x2018;Which end would you like?&#x2019; and I would say, &#x2018;The shallow end; Lee keeps pissing himself.&#x2019; &#x201d;8 Family photos show that the house was a typical modern working-class home with a fitted patterned carpet, floral sofas with wooden arms, papered walls and gilt-framed reproductions of paintings by Constable. At the back of the house there was a small paved garden with a raised fishpond and a white gate that led out onto a grassy communal area in front of a tower block.<br> <br>Ron couldn&#x2019;t work because of his condition, and money was in short supply. Janet left school at fifteen and took a job in London Bridge in the offices of a dried egg import business to help support the family. Her brother Tony recalls how difficult it was for the family to survive. &#x201c;My mum would give me the money to go on the bus to where Janet was working, to get her wages off her, and then I would bring the money back to my mum and meet her and do the shopping with her,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Mum was working as well, doing cleaning in the morning and the evening.&#x201d;9<br> <br>When Ron returned from Cane Hill to the house in Stratford, he trained to become a black-cab driver so he could work the hours that suited him. He had, in Joyce&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;wonderful willpower to get better again.&#x201d;10 He took up fishing and snooker and finally started to earn a little more money. Life in 1970s Britain was, for many ordinary families like the McQueens, a rather grim affair. In 1974 there were two general elections and the country was gripped by economic and social unrest. Power cuts were a regular feature of daily life (a three-day weekly limit for the commercial consumption of electricity had been imposed), rubbish went uncollected for weeks and unemployment surged past the all-important one million mark (by 1978 it stood at 1.5 million).<br> <br>Yet the work ethic was strong in the McQueen family&#x2014;Ron eventually bought the house from the council in 1982&#x2014;and he expected his sons to get steady and reliable jobs as plumbers, electricians, bricklayers or cabdrivers. The upbringing was strict, almost Victorian. If he saw his children &#x201c;getting beyond or above themselves,&#x201d; he would try and bring them back down to earth, quashing their confidence in the process. &#x201c;We were seen and not heard,&#x201d; said Lee&#x2019;s sister Jacqui.11 By the time Tony was fourteen he had traveled all over the country with Ron in a lorry. &#x201c;So my education suffered a bit,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That was me and Michael&#x2019;s childhood.&#x201d;12 Tony left school to work as a bricklayer and Michael became a taxi driver like his father. They were born into the working classes and their father believed that any aspiration above and beyond that would not only lead to personal unhappiness and dissatisfaction but would serve as a betrayal of their roots too. Creativity in any form was frowned upon and regarded as a total waste of time; dreaming was all well and good but it would not put food on the table.<br> <br>It was into this world that Lee, a sensitive, bright child with a vivid imagination, was born. From the very beginning the cherubic-looking boy strived for something more, a desire that he found he could express through the medium of clothes. When he was three he picked up a crayon lying around his sisters&#x2019; bedroom and drew an image of Cinderella, &#x201c;with a tiny waist and a huge gown,&#x201d; on a bare wall.13 &#x201c;He told me about that Cinderella drawing on the wall, I thought it was quite magical,&#x201d; said his friend Alice Smith, who visited the house in Biggerstaff Road a number of times. &#x201c;I also remember him telling me about how one day his mum dressed him up to go out when he was little. He was wearing trousers with an anorak and they were going to the park and he said, &#x2018;Mum, I can&#x2019;t wear this.&#x2019; She asked him why not and he replied, &#x2018;It doesn&#x2019;t go.&#x2019; &#x201d;14 His sisters started to ask him about what they should wear to work and he soon became their &#x201c;daily style consultant.&#x201d; &#x201c;I was absorbed early on by the style of people, by how they expressed themselves through what they wear,&#x201d; he said.15<br> <br>When Lee was three or four he was playing by himself at the top of the house in a bedroom that looked out towards Lund Point, a twenty-three-story tower block behind the terrace. He climbed onto a small ottoman that sat beneath the window and pushed the window wide open. Just as he was stretching out to reach through the window his sister Janet walked into the bedroom. &#x201c;The window had no safety catch and he was stood on the ottoman reaching out,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I thought to myself, &#x2018;No, don&#x2019;t say anything.&#x2019; I went up behind him and grabbed him. I probably told him off because he could easily have fallen out of the window.&#x201d;16 He was, by all accounts, a mischievous, spirited little boy. He stole his mother&#x2019;s false teeth and put them in his mouth for a joke or repeated the same trick with a piece of orange peel cut into jagged, teeth-like shapes. He would take hold of his mother&#x2019;s stockings and pull them over his head to frighten people. With his sisters he would go along to the local swimming club to take part in synchronized-swimming competitions. &#x201c;You would hear our trainer, Sid, shouting, &#x2018;Lee&#x2014;Lee McQueen?&#x2019; and he would be under the water looking at us,&#x201d; said Jacqui. &#x201c;Or he would have a hula skirt on and suddenly jump into the water. He was so funny.&#x201d;17 One day, Lee did a backflip off the side of the swimming pool and hit his cheekbone, an accident that left him with a small lump.<br> <br>After Lee and Joyce&#x2019;s deaths her treasured photograph albums were passed around between her remaining five children. Seeing images of Lee as a boy, looking bright-eyed and full of fun, was especially hard for the McQueens. Here was Lee with a swathe of white fabric around his head, his right foot wrapped in a bandage, his left eye smudged with makeup so as to give him a black eye, and a cane in one hand and a box of chocolates in the other; around his neck hangs the sign &#x201c;All Because the Lady Loved Milk Tray.&#x201d; There are plenty more taken at similar holiday camp competitions&#x2014;one of him holding a prize while staying at Pontins and another of him, when he was only three or so, dancing with a little girl the same age, his blond hair falling down the side of his head, his mouth open wide with joy. There is one of him enjoying being picked up and cuddled by a man in a panda suit and another of him looking a little more self-conscious, probably a photograph taken at junior school, trying to smile but careful to keep his mouth closed because he did not want his prominent and uneven front teeth to show. One day when Lee was a young boy he tripped off the small wall in the back garden of the house in Biggerstaff Road and hit his teeth. &#x201c;He was always self-conscious about his teeth after that,&#x201d; said Tony.18 &#x201c;I remember he had an accident when he was younger and lost his milk teeth and the others came through damaged or twisted,&#x201d; said Peter Bowes, a school friend who knew him from the age of five. &#x201c;So he had these buck front teeth, one of the things that would give him a reason to be humiliated and picked on. He was called &#x2018;goofy&#x2019; and things like that.&#x201d;19<br> <br>Lee knew that he was not like other boys from an early age, but the exact nature and source of this difference were still unclear to him. His mother picked up the fact that her youngest son was a strange mix of surface toughness and unusual vulnerabilities and did everything she could to protect him. &#x201c;He was this little fat boy from the East End with bad teeth who didn&#x2019;t have much to offer, but he had this one special thing, this talent, and Joyce believed in him,&#x201d; said Alice Smith. &#x201c;He told me once that she had said to him, &#x2018;Whatever you want to do, do it.&#x2019; He was adored; they had a special relationship, it was a mutual adoration.&#x201d;20<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>When Lee was a boy he would watch in wonder as his mother unrolled an eight-foot-long scroll decorated with elaborate coats of arms. She would point out the names of long-dead ancestors on the family tree and talk about the past. Joyce was passionate about genealogy&#x2014;she later taught the subject at Canning Town Adult Education Centre&#x2014;and she told her young son that she suspected that the McQueen side of the family had originated from the Isle of Skye. Lee had become increasingly fascinated with the island&#x2019;s gothic history and his ancestors&#x2019; place in it. It was on a holiday with Janet in 2007 that he first visited the small cemetery in Kilmuir&#x2014;the last resting place of the Jacobite heroine Flora MacDonald&#x2014;and saw a grave marked with the name Alexander McQueen; in May 2010, the designer&#x2019;s cremated remains were buried in the same graveyard.<br> <br>Joyce spent years plotting out the family tree, but by the end of her research she had failed to find any definitive evidence linking her husband&#x2019;s McQueen ancestors to Skye. But, like many things in Lee&#x2019;s life, the romance of the idea was more alluring than the reality. Listening to his mother&#x2019;s tales of Scotland&#x2019;s brutal history, and the suffering that his ancestors endured at the hands of the English landowners, he constructed an imaginative bloodline across the centuries. One of the attractions of boyfriend Murray Arthur was the fact that he was from north of the border. &#x201c;He was obsessed by Scotland, and loved the fact that I was Scottish,&#x201d; he said.21 Lee&#x2019;s bond with Scotland grew increasingly strong over the years&#x2014;it inspired collections such as Highland Rape (1995) and Widows of Culloden (2006)&#x2014;and in 2004, when his mother asked him what his Scottish roots meant to him, McQueen replied, &#x201c;Everything.&#x201d;22<br> <br>Joyce McQueen&#x2019;s journey back into the past started when her husband asked her to find out about the origins of his family: &#x201c;Are we Irish or Scottish?&#x201d; By 1992, she had gathered her work into a manuscript that told the story of the McQueens&#x2019; roots. &#x201c;Researching family history can be fun, but more than this it can give us a sense of belonging and how we came to be,&#x201d; wrote Joyce.23 For Lee, this was especially important as it provided him with a connection to history and opened up possibilities that allowed his imagination to fly.<br> <br>Joyce noted how the earliest mention of the name McQueen on the Isle of Skye was in the fourtee...</p><h2>Harry Potter - The Illustrated Collection</h2><p>These three irresistible complete novels contain over 800 pages of classic storytelling from J.K.

Though their climbing skills taught them a thing or two about survival, it was their individual characters and their compassion for one another that kept them alive. Like anyone who has witnessed warfare and death, they feel pain over the memories that they recount in this story. It is their hope that others may learn from their experience.&#x201d; &#x2014;from the Introduction<br><br>Before dawn on August 12, 2000, four of America&#x2019;s best young rock climbers, the oldest of them only twenty-five, were sleeping in their portaledges high on the Yellow Wall, in the Pamir-Alai mountain range of Kyrgyzstan, in central Asia. By daybreak, they would be taken at gunpoint by fanatical militants of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), which operates out of secret bases in Tajikistan and Afghanistan, and which is linked to Osama bin Laden&#x2019;s Al Qaeda network. The desperadoes&#x2014;themselves barely out of their teens&#x2014;intended to use their hostages as human shields and for ransom as they moved across Kyrgyzstan. They hid the climbers by day and marched them by night through freezing, treacherous mountains, with little food, no clean water, and the constant threat of execution. The four would see a fellow hostage, a Kyrgyz soldier, executed before their eyes. And in a remarkable life-and-death crucible over six terrifying days, they would be forced to choose between saving their own lives and committing an act none of them thought they ever could. <br><br>In Over the Edge, the four climbers&#x2014;Jason &#x201c;Singer&#x201d; Smith, John Dickey, Tommy Caldwell, and Beth Rodden&#x2014;finally tell the complete story of their nightmarish ordeal. In riveting detail, author Greg Child re-creates the entire hour-by-hour drama, from the first ricocheting bullets to the climactic and agonizing decision the climbers had to make in order to gain their freedom and survival. Set in a powder-keg region of narcotics trafficking and terrorism, this is a deeply compelling book about loyalty and the unshakeable human will to survive.</p><p>A year before America woke to the madness of Islamic terrorism, four young American rock climbers were pulled directly into its line of fire on a rock climbing expedition 80 miles from Afghanistan. Oblivious to the volatile mix of ethnic strife, drug smuggling, and militant Islam brewing there, the four had been seeking extreme adventure in the "Yosemite Valley" of Central Asia. Greg Child gives a riveting chronicle of their capture by militants of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (linked to al Qaeda), who dragged them through six harrowing days of gun battles before the four made their dramatic escape. As a veteran climber of the area and a seasoned writer, Child was uniquely qualified to write "the story that refused to stop unfolding," scrupulously tracking the moments that led to the ultimate decision--whether to kill to live--and the firestorm of controversy and skepticism that surrounded the four on their return to a still-ignorant America. To learn the truth, Child even traveled to Kyrgyzstan with two of the climbers to face one of their captors. <i>Over the Edge</i> is a charged and unforgettable look into the many faces of international terrorism and human nature itself. <i>--Lesley Reed</i>Greg Child is a writer for Outside. He is the author of three books, most recently the climbing memoir Postcards from the Ledge.

Nations are not trapped by their pasts, but events that happened hundreds or even thousands of years ago continue to exert huge influence on present-day politics. If we are to understand the politics that we now take for granted, we need to understand its origins. Francis Fukuyama examines the paths that different societies have taken to reach their current forms of political order. This book starts with the very beginning of mankind and comes right up to the eve of the French and American revolutions, spanning such diverse disciplines as economics, anthropology and geography. &#34;The Origins of Political Order&#34; is a magisterial study on the emergence of mankind as a political animal, by one of the most eminent political thinkers writing today.</p><p>Francis Fukuyama is the author of The End of History, Trust, The Great Disruption, Our Posthuman Future, State Building and After the Neocons. All have been international bestsellers, translated and published in many languages. They have also been hugely influential. Fukuyama is in constant demand around the world in the media and as a speaker. He is Olivier Nomellini Senior Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Stanford.<b>Origins of Political Order</b><br><b>PART ONE</b><b><i>Before the State</i></b><b>1</b><b>THE NECESSITY OF POLITICS</b>The third wave of democratization and contemporary anxieties about the future of contemporary liberal democracy; how both the Left and the Right entertain fantasies about the abolition of government; how contemporary developing countries represent the fulfillment of these fantasies; how we take institutions for granted but in fact have no idea where they come fromDuring the forty-year period from 1970 to 2010, there was an enormous upsurge in the number of democracies around the world. In 1973, only 45 of the world's 151 countries were counted as "free" by Freedom House, a nongovernmental organization that produces quantitative measures of civil and political rights for countries around the world.1 That year, Spain, Portugal, and Greece were dictatorships; the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites looked like strong and cohesive societies; China was caught up in Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution; Africa saw the consolidation of rule by a group of corrupt "presidents for life"; and most of Latin America had fallen under military dictatorship. The following generation saw momentous political change, with democracies and market-oriented economies spreading in virtually every part of the world except for the Arab Middle East. By the late 1990s, some 120 countries around the world--more than 60 percent of the world's independent states--had become electoral democracies.2 This transformation was Samuel Huntington's third wave of democratization; liberal democracy as the default form of government became part of the accepted political landscape at the beginning of the twenty-first century.3Underlying these changes in political systems was a massive social transformation as well. The shift to democracy was a result of millions of formerly passive individuals around the world organizing themselves and participating in the political life of their societies. This social mobilizationwas driven by a host of factors: greatly expanded access to education that made people more aware of themselves and the political world around them; information technology, which facilitated the rapid spread of ideas and knowledge; cheap travel and communications that allowed people to vote with their feet if they didn't like their government; and greater prosperity, which induced people to demand better protection of their rights.The third wave crested after the late 1990s, however, and a "democratic recession" emerged in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Approximately one in five countries that had been part of the third wave either reverted to authoritarianism or saw a significant erosion of democratic institutions.4 Freedom House noted that 2009 marked the fourth consecutive year in which freedom had declined around the world, the first time this had happened since it established its measures of freedom in 1973.5<b>POLITICAL ANXIETIES</b>At the beginning of the second decade of the twenty-first century, malaise in the democratic world took several distinct forms. The first was the outright reversal of democratic gains that had occurred in countries such as Russia, Venezuela, and Iran, where elected leaders were busy dismantling democratic institutions by manipulating elections, closing down or buying independent TV and newspaper outlets, and clamping down on opposition activities. Liberal democracy is more than majority voting in elections; it is a complex set of institutions that restrain and regularize the exercise of power through law and a system of checks and balances. In many countries, official acceptance of democratic legitimacy was accompanied by the systematic removal of checks on executive power and the erosion of the rule of law.In other cases, countries that seemed to be making a transition from authoritarian government got stuck in what the analyst Thomas Carothers has labeled a "gray zone," where they were neither fully authoritarian nor meaningfully democratic.6 Many successor states to the former Soviet Union, like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in Central Asia, found themselves in this situation. There had been a broad assumption in the years following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 that virtually all countries were transitioning to democracy and that failures of democratic practice would be overcome with the simple passage of time. Carothers pointed out that this"transition paradigm" was an unwarranted assumption and that many authoritarian elites had no interest in implementing democratic institutions that would dilute their power.A third category of concern has to do not with the failure of political systems to become or remain democratic but rather their failure to deliver the basic services that people demand from their governments. The mere fact that a country has democratic institutions tells us very little about whether it is well or badly governed. This failure to deliver on the promise of democracy poses what is perhaps the greatest challenge to the legitimacy of such political systems.An example of this was Ukraine. Ukraine surprised the world in 2004 when tens of thousands of people turned up in Kiev's Maidan Square to protest manipulation of that country's presidential election. These protests, which came to be known as the Orange Revolution, triggered a new election and the rise of the reformer Viktor Yushchenko as president. Once in power, however, the Orange Coalition proved utterly feckless, and Yushchenko himself disappointed the hopes of those who supported him. The government quarreled internally, failed to deal with Ukraine's serious corruption problem, and presided over a meltdown of the economy during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. The result was the election in early 2010 of Viktor Yanukovich, the very man accused of stealing the 2004 election that had triggered the Orange Revolution in the first place.Many other species of governance failure plague democratic countries. It is well understood that Latin America has the highest level of economic inequality of any region in the world, in which class hierarchies often correspond to racial and ethnic ones. The rise of populist leaders like Hugo Ch�vez in Venezuela and Evo Morales in Bolivia is less a cause of instability than a symptom of that inequality and the feeling of social exclusion felt by many who are nominally citizens. Persistent poverty often breeds other kinds of social dysfunctions, like gangs, narcotrafficking, and a general feeling of insecurity on the part of ordinary people. In Colombia, Mexico, and El Salvador, organized criminality threatens the state itself and its basic institutions, and the failure to deal effectively with these problems has undermined the legitimacy of democracy.India, to take another example, has been a remarkably successful democracy since its independence in 1947--an achievement all the more remarkable given its poverty, ethnic and religious diversity, and enormous size. (Why a longer historical view of Indian political development shouldlessen our surprise is the subject of chapters 10-12.) Nonetheless, Indian democracy, like sausage making, looks less appealing the closer one gets to the process. Nearly one-third of Indian legislators, for example, are under some form of criminal indictment, some for serious crimes like murder and rape. Indian politicians often practice an overt form of patronage politics, in which votes are traded for political favors. The fractiousness of Indian democracy makes it very hard for the government to make major decisions on issues like investments in major infrastructure projects. And in many Indian cities, glittering high-tech centers of excellence exist next to African-style poverty.The apparent chaos and corruption of democratic politics in India has frequently been contrasted to the quick and efficient decision making of China. Chinese rulers are not constrained by either a rule of law or democratic accountability; if they want to build a huge dam, bulldoze neighborhoods to make way for highways or airports, or mount a rapid economic stimulus package, they can do so far more quickly than democratic India.A fourth broad source of political anxiety concerns the economy. Modern global capitalism has proved to be productive and wealth-creating beyond the dreams of anyone living before the year 1800. In the period following the oil crises of the 1970s, the size of the world economy almost quadrupled,7 and Asia, based on its openness to trade and investment, saw much of its population join the developed world. But global capitalism has not found a way to avoid high levels of volatility, particularly in the financial sector. Global economic growth has been plagued by periodic financial crises, striking Europe in the early 1990s, Asia in 1997-1998, Russia and Brazil in 1998-1999, and Argentina in 2001. This instability culminated, perhaps with poetic justice, in the great crisis that struck the United States, the home of global capitalism, in 2008-2009. Free markets are necessary to promote long-term growth, but they are not self-regulating, particularly when it comes to banks and other large financial institutions. The system's instability is a reflection of what is ultimately a political failure, that is, the failure to provide sufficient regulatory oversight both at a national and an international level.8The cumulative effect of these economic crises has not necessarily been to undermine confidence in market-based economics and globalization as engines of economic growth. China, India, Brazil, and any number of other so-called emerging market countries continue to perform well economically based on their participation in global capitalism. But it is clear that the<i>political</i> job of finding the right regulatory mechanisms to tame capitalism's volatility have not yet been found.<b>POLITICAL DECAY</b></p><h2>The Hole in Our Gospel: What Does God Expect of Us?</h2><p>Encouraging Christians to love their neighbors, the president of World Vision examines the manner in which worldwide poverty is handled and how it must be changed and inspires individuals to reach out by using their time, talent, and money.</p><p><p><b>Richard Stearns</b> has served as president&nbsp;of World Vision U.S. since 1998, having formerly been the CEO of Parker Bros.

His journey to this place took more than a long flight from the United States to Africa. It took answering God's call on his life, a call that hurtled him out of his presidential corner office at Lenox-America's finest tableware company-to this humble corner of Uganda. This is a story of how a corporate CEO faced his own struggle to obey God whatever the cost, and his passionate call for Christians to change the world by actively living out their faith. Using his own journey as an example, Stearns explores the hole that exists in our understanding of the Gospel. Two thousand years ago, twelve people changed the world. Stearns believes it can happen again. "Read this compelling story and urgent call for change-Richard Stearns is a contemporary Amos crying 'let justice roll down like waters�&#x20ac;�.'

These 200 classic dishes are as sophisticated and eclectic as the first time the innovative cooks of the Moosewood Collective served them. Bon App?�tit named Moosewood Restaurant one of the 13 most revolutionary restaurants since the beginning of the 20th century. From soups and sandwiches to main dishes, this spirited collection of creative and accessible recipes will liven up your table.</p><p>MOOSEWOOD RESTAURANT -- named one of the 13 most revolutionary restaurants in the 20th century --has been operating in upstate New York since 1973. The first edition of NEW RECIPES FROM MOOSEWOOD RESTAURANT by the Collective sold over 240,000 copies.Ten years ago, Mollie Katzen's Moosewood Cookbook popularized the meatless fare of the Ithaca restaurant, and this latest effort proves that the Moosewood Collective still has its finger on the pulse of superior, innovative vegetarian cuisine. A new sophistication is evident: Katzen's hand lettering, a much-imitated cookbook motif, is replaced by more practical, conventional type, and dishes like chilled buttermilk and berry soups are surpassed by chilled cantaloupe-amaretto and avocado-grapefruit offerings. Inspired by ethnic and international traditions, and enhanced by fresh, seasonal ingredients, the delicious recipes feature fish with Cantonese black-bean sauce, Japanese braised eggplant, West African groundnut stew, Russian vegetable strudel, Tuscan potato salad and apricot baklava. Directions are lucid and straightforward, and even the more complicated dishes are accessible to novices. A detailed appendix defines ingredients, equipment and techniques, but preparation times are omitted from this Moosewood version. Illustrations not seen by PW.

Unlike most almanacs, however, this one contains information and insight that helps us navigate through every year, that helps us find our way Home. Containing a reflection for each of the 365 days of the year (each entry approximately one page long), The Old Hermit&#39;s Almanac also celebrates holy days and holidays, feast days and famous days of the past, and glimpses into the future. It marks accomplishments of yesterday that inspire us to live well tomorrow and points out &#34;pedestrian&#34; prophecies of the past, off-target predictions that show the folly of forecasting, especially those predictions that limit our possibilities.</p><p></p><h2>Myth, Allegory, and Gospel: An Interpretation of JRR Tolkien, CS Lewis, GK Chesterton, Chas Williams</h2><p>If you are a &#34;fan&#34; of the fantasy books by Tolkien, C.S.Lewis, Charles Williams or Chesterton, then this is a book worth reading. It is a collection of essays by various authorities in literature, myth and theology. A couple of the contributors were acquainted with either Tolkien or Lewis. The central thesis running through this collection of essays is that mythic symbols found in folk-tales and religious rituals, all express a common, fundamental human yearning for healing and a return to a &#34;lost paradise&#34;. The essayists draw on insights from religious phenomenology, Jungian analysis, Christian theology and literary interpretation to tease out the potent mythic symbols found in the writings of Tolkien, Lewis, Chesterton and Williams. Lewis, Williams and Tolkien were associated with one another as drinking partners in an informal literary club known as The Inklings. The essayists &#34;test&#34; their thesis about the power of myth to reveal our search for meaning through the novels of the Inklings. The essayists take us a step further to consider the Christian world-view that informed and shaped the writings of Tolkien, Lewis, Williams and Chesterton. Although a couple of the essays are slightly &#34;dated&#34;, any one interested in fantasy literature would find the thesis very absorbing. It should be useful not merely to students of english literature but also to the general reader who might like to know more about the backdrop to The Lord of the Rings, Narnia, etc. Certainly a book to add to your list for reading if you enjoyed the novels!</p><p>John Warwick Montgomery, editor and contributor to this collection of essays, is Professor Emeritus of Law and Humanities, University of Bedfordshire, England; Distinguished Research Professor of Philosophy and Christian Thought, Patrick Henry College, Virginia.

The connection isn't as odd as it might sound at first, and Picoult has written another page-turning novel, even as it focuses on motherhood, loss, and grief. Teenager Jenna Metcalf was just three years old when her mother disappeared from an elephant sanctuary. Ten years later, she takes up the search for her mother, Alice, by studying Alice&#x2019;s decade-old journals on grieving elephants. The research itself is fascinating, the hints about Alice&#x2019;s disappearance are compelling; but Jenna cannot find her mother on her own. By enlisting the help of a formerly famous&#x2014;now infamous&#x2014;psychic, as well as a down-and-out private detective whose career went south during the botched investigation of Alice's disappearance, Jenna forms a sort of new family to help her in her quest. As the facts begin to come together&#x2014;described in alternating chapters by Jenna, the psychic, the private detective, and Alice&#x2019;s journals&#x2014;it all heads toward a thrilling conclusion. And, yes, there is a big twist at the end. &#x2013; <i>Chris Schluep</i></p>Jodi Picoult is the author of twenty-two novels, including the no. 1 international""bestsellers "The Storyteller, Lone Wolf, Between the Lines, Sing You Home, House Rules, Handle with Care, Change of Heart, Nineteen Minutes, "and "My Sister's Keeper."

If anything, this book is more pointed and trenchant than its predecessor. Having watched as hundreds of zinesters, graffiti artists, and Hollywood hipster wanna-bes ripped off their imagery and ideas, the SubGenii have gained even more insight into the wretchedness of the human need to follow rather than create. Encouraging this tendency in others while also making a buck off of it, the SubGenii have produced a well-aimed and painfully funny volume that parodies religion, the cult of cool, the notion of an underground, and the very idea of selling out.Its hour come round at last: the prophesied do-it-yourself end times religion for swinging mutants and terminal abnormals! Eternal Salvation- or triple your money back. Beyond science, reason, and orgasm. Instant instructions for those who follow no master!

Faced with ill health, poverty, and marital servitude on the one hand, and opportunities for financial independence, dignity, and self-worth on the other, Kitty Warren follows her sister into a successful career in prostitution. Shaw&#x2019;s fierce social criticism in this play is driven not by conventional morality, but by anger at the hypocrisy that allows society to condemn prostitution while condoning the discrimination against women that makes prostitution inevitable. </p> <p> This Broadview edition includes a comprehensive historical and critical introduction; extracts from Shaw&#x2019;s prefaces to the play; Shaw&#x2019;s expurgations of the text; early reviews of the play in the United States, Canada, and Great Britain; and contemporary contextual documents on prostitution, incest, censorship, women&#x2019;s education, and the &#x201c;New Woman.&#x201d; </p></p><p><i>Mrs Warren's Profession</i> found its way onto the stage amidst much censorship, and police and public outcry. This book serves as an authoritative student edition to guide exams and essays.Modern parallels abound in the plight of Cambridge-educated mathematics wiz Vivie Warren, who discovers that her comfortable upbringing was financed in unspeakable ways. Shaw pits a clever heroine against a memorable gallery of rogues in this superbly intelligent -- and still shocking -- comedy, banned for eight years from the English stage. <p> An L.A.

Frankweiler</h2><p>When Claudia decided to run away, she planned very carefully She would be gone just long enough to teach her parents a lesson in Claudia appreciation.&nbsp;&nbsp;And she would live in comfort-at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.&nbsp;&nbsp;She invited her brother Jamie to go, too, mostly because he was a miser and would have money<br>The two took up residence in the museum right on schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;But once the fun of settling in was over, Claudia had two unexpected problems: She felt just the same, and she wanted to feel different; and she found a statue at the museum so beautiful she could not go home until she had discovered its maker, a question that baffled even the experts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The former owner of the statue was Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler And without her help Claudia might never have found a way to go home.</p><p>Claudia is bored. She's ready for a big change, but wants to make sure she does it with style. When she decides to run away, Claudia plans to be a runaway with specific goals: to be comfortable, to be changed, and to be appreciated at home. She carefully appoints a partner (her younger brother), and selects a destination (The Metropolitan Museum of Art), but there are some adventures you simply can't plan in advance. Claudia and her brother Jamie are soon embroiled in an artistic mystery even the experts can't solve, but discovering a solution to this puzzle might just help Claudia find the answer to her personal quest.<p> Konigsburg's unique story, compelling style, and distinctive line drawings make this Newbery Medal-winner a book readers won't want to put down. Especially for children on the cusp of adolescence, Claudia's desire to <i>be</i> someone and her corresponding search for identity will ring true for those searching for their true selves. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i></p>E.L. Konigsburg has never spent the night in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, like the heroine of her Newbery Medal-winning novel, From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, does. But she was born in New York, and she is a part-time painter. In fact she's done the illustrations for a number of books.<br>&nbsp;<br>Konigsburg did not grow up in the city. Her family moved to Pennsylvania when she was young, and most of her childhood was spent in small towns in that state. When she attended Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, she majored in chemistry, and after graduation she worked as a chemist, doing research and teaching. It wasn't until after she was married and had three children in school that Konigsburg began writing books.<br>&nbsp;<br>What is exceptional about Konigsburg is her ability to communicate convincingly from the point of view of a child. As the reviewer for <i>The Horn Book</i> said of <i>Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, Elizabeth,</i> "The story is full...of situations completely in tune with the imaginations of ten-year-old girls." One of Konigsburg's characters, Ben in (George), has an ornery inner voice called George that seems to have come from the mind of a real child.<br>&nbsp;<br>Konigsburg, who now lives with her family in Ponte Vedra Beach, FL, is the author of many books for children with a wide variety of subjects and settings. One of them is a novelized biography of Eleanor of Aquitaine; several are collections of short stories; another is a historical novel about the Mona Lisa; and the rest are wonderful novels. Most of her books were named American Library Association Notable Children's Books, and a number were chosen by <i>The Horn Book</i> magazine for its Fanfare List. <i>From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler</i> won the Newbery Medal and <i>Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, Elizabeth </i>was named a Newbery Honor Book.</p><h2>Tuesday Takes Me There: The Healing Journey of a Veteran and his Service Dog</h2><p><p><strong>As praised in the #1 bestselling book&nbsp;<em>Al Franken, Giant of the Senate&nbsp;</em>by Al Franken</strong><br> <br> <strong>From New York's Staten Island Ferry to a double-decker bus in Washington, DC, a delightful service dog, named Tuesday, narrates this fun and exciting journey&nbsp;with his disabled veteran partner&nbsp;to a very special place.</strong><br>&nbsp; <br>Tuesday and&nbsp;Luis, an Iraq War veteran, must travel by boat, bus, train, horse, pedicab and more as they race from New York City to the countryside outside the nation's capitol for an important event.

Luis and Tuesday reside in New York City, but travel most of the year on their mission of advocacy and education.K-Gr 2&#x2014;Another charming tale of service dog Tuesday and his owner Montalv�n. In this title, Tuesday and Montalv�n, a 17-year army veteran who now advocates for veterans with disabilities, travel to a variety of tourist sites in the New York City and Washington, DC, area. Tuesday is the narrator throughout the story, explaining how she supports Montalv�n from morning to night. Dion's great photographs show the duo having fun throughout the trip. The work highlights key attractions in each city. It is definitely a whirlwind tour: Tuesday and Montalv�n ride 12 forms of transportation and eventually end up in a library&#x2014;just in time for storytime. Montalv�n read his book to an audience of children while Tuesday sleeps. A website that includes activity sheets for teachers is featured. Young readers in need of information about service dogs or reassurance about post-traumatic stress disorder will appreciate the light tone of this book.

Malcolm Muggeridge s writing dazzles with its prophetic insight, courage and humour. He was the first writer to reveal the true nature of Stalin s regime when in 1933 he exposed the terror famine in the Ukraine one of the most monstrous crimes in history, so terrible that people in the future will scarcely believe it ever happened . Four decades later, Muggeridge was to make the work of Mother Teresa of Calcutta who contributed a Foreword to this book during the initial stages of its research known all over the world. But this enthralling collection reveals the astonishing range and steadiness of his gaze. Muggeridge seems to have been present at the great turning points of the last century and to have known, and seen through, the pretensions of many of its protagonists. Painstakingly researched from amongst Muggeridge s private papers, journals, letters and unpublished works, Time and Eternity gives a unique and inspirational insight into the professional and private journey of one of the great writers of our time.</p><p></p><h2>The Culture Struggle</h2><p>One of America&#x2019;s most astute and engaging political analysts, Michael Parenti shows us that culture is a changing process and the product of a dynamic interplay between a wide range of social and political interests. Drawing from cultures around the world, Parenti shows that beliefs and practices are readily subjected to political manipulation, and that many parts of culture are being commodified, separated from their group or communal origins, to be packaged and sold to those who can pay for them. Folk culture is giving way to a corporate market culture. Art, science, medicine, and psychiatry can be used as instruments of cultural control, and even marriage, the "foundation of society," has been misused by heterosexuals across the centuries.<br>Using vivid examples and riveting arguments throughout, ranging from the everyday to the esoteric, and penned with eloquence and irony, The Culture Struggle presents a collection of snapshots of our time.</p><p>MICHAEL PARENTI is a critically acclaimed author and an extraordinary public speaker. He received his Ph.D. in political science from Yale University and has taught at a number of colleges and universities, in the United States and abroad.

Many of them have Googled phrases like "stroke Nancy Zieman" in an effort to discover the reasons behind the partial paralysis of Nancy's beautiful face. Viewers purchased products Nancy used through Nancy's Notions, followed patterns she created for McCall's, and enjoyed meeting distinguished guests via the show.<br> <br> While today's Christian women read of Lydia and the Proverbs 31 woman and wonder how we can ever practice our faith so well in today's harried existence, Nancy Zieman was quietly living out her faith in Wisconsin. Her large Lutheran family ordered their lives around the farm, the seasons, and the church. As Nancy wrestled with the difficulties borne by the Bell's palsy, she also learned to rely heavily on God and believe that He had a purpose for her, a life lived to honor Him. Little did she realize that God would take a woman with half a paralyzed face and bless her with the longest running sewing show on North American television.&nbsp;<br> <br> For the first time, Nancy shares openly about the Bell's palsy that not only affected her appearance, but also her esteem and physical abilities. Readers learn about the growth of Nancy professionally: from addressing catalogs at the kitchen table to growing a multi-million dollar notions business - and personally: marrying Rich, then growing a family through birth and adoption.&nbsp;<br> <br> Through it all, the picture emerges of a hard-working woman of staunch faith who overcame various and varied obstacles to become what she is today: successful, humble, skilled, gracious, grateful and loved by millions of viewers.&nbsp;<br> <br> For any woman who has wondered how God could possibly build a purposeful life from one so unlikely, Nancy Zieman serves as a beautiful example of a life lived one step at a time, as He allows.&nbsp;</p><p>Nancy Zieman is host of&nbsp;<em>Sewing with Nancy</em>, TV's longest-running sewing show, which she co-produces with Wisconsin Public Television. It has been on-air since 1982.

Nancy is not only a legend and icon for the sewing industry; she is an educator and business woman extraordinaire.&nbsp;This book will capture your heart and your attention to the end.&nbsp;My heartfelt thanks go to Nancy for her willingness to support the sewing industry with such passion and grace.<br> &nbsp;<br> Joanne Ross<br> Founder and Director, Sewing &amp; Stitchery Expo<br> Appearances are not always as they seem.

She was educated at Downe House School in Kent. She is considered by many to be one of the most distinguished novelists of the twentieth century. Her first book, a collection of short stories, Encounters, appeared in 1923, followed by another, Ann Lee&#39;s, in 1926. The Hotel was her first novel, and was followed by The Last September, Joining Charles, another book of short stories, Friends and Relations, To the North, The Cat Jumps, The House of Paris, The Death of the Heart, Look at All Those Roses, The Demon Lover, The Heat of the Day, Collected Impressions, The Shelbourne, A World of Love, A Time in Rome, After-thought, The Little Girls, A Day in the Dark and Eve Trout. She was awarded the CBE in 1948, and received the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1949 and from Oxford University in 1956. In the same year she was appointed Lacy Martin Donnelly Fellow at Bryn Mawr College in the United States. In 1965 she was made a Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature. Elizabeth Bowen died in 1973. Hermione Lee grew up in London, was educated at Oxford, began her academic career as a lecturer in Williamsburg, Virginia and at Liverpool, and taught at the University of York from 1977, where she was Professor of English until her recent appointment to the Goldsmiths&#39; Chair of English Literature and Fellow of New College at the University of Oxford. She is well-known as a writer, reviewer and broadcaster. From 1982 to 1986 she presented Channel Four&#39;s first books programme, Book Four. Her publications include a critical study of the novels of Virgina Woolf, a book on Philip Roth, a biography of Willa Cather, a popular two-volume anthology of short stories by women writers, The Secret Self, and numerous editions, of Bowen, Woolf, Stevie Smith, Welty, Wharton, Kipling and others. Her biography of Virgina Woolf was published in 1996 and was greeted with great acclaim. It was chosen as a New York Times Book Review Best Book of the Year, and short-listed for the W H Smith Prize, the Duff Cooper Prize, the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and the National Book Critics&#39; Circle Award in Biography in the USA. Elizabeth Bowen was first published in 1981 and revised in 1999 for Bowen&#39;s centenary.These essays, prefaces, reviews, letters and talks by Anglo-Irish novelist and short-story writer Bowen (18991973) include reminiscences and autobiographical sketches of schoolgirl years, wartime London, breaking into print, as well as commentaries on Ivy Compton-Burnett, Cyril Connolly, Angus Wilson, Eudora Welty and other contemporaries. Among the letters are several to Virginia Woolf and William Plomer and part of a previously published correspondence with Graham Greene and V. S. Pritchett on "Why Do I Write?" Articles evaluate the work of Flaubert, Trollope and Katharine Mansfield. That Bowen's criticism and occasional writings are inextricably related to her fiction is well brought out by Lee (Elizabeth Bowen: An Estimation in her preface and sectional introductions.

Casti is a member of the faculty of the Santa Fe Institute and a professor at the Technical University of Vienna. He divides his time between Santa Fe, New Mexico and Vienna.Casti draws the reader into current scientific controversies as he weighs the pros and cons of puzzling questions: Did life on earth arise from a "primordial organic soup"? Can a machine ever duplicate human cognitive processes? How do children acquire the ability to speak their native language? Is there validity to sociobiologists' claims that human behavior patterns are genetically determined? Quantum physics, artificial intelligence and astronomers' search for intelligent life in the universe are among the topics explored in an engaging, elegant, personal fashion. Casti, author of Alternate Realities , spotlights the role of passion and politics in scientific debate. However, he highhandedly dismisses research into UFOs, Bigfoot (yeti) and "even more offbeat phenomena" as the work of pseudoscientific cranks, thus himself mirroring the attitudes of scientists whose blinkered viewpoints on other topics he so deftly exposes.

Dor�'s dreamlike, otherworldly style, tinged with melancholy, seems ideally matched to the bleak despair of Poe's celebrated work, among the most popular American poems ever written.<br>This volume reprints all 26 of Dor�'s detailed, masterly engravings from a rare 19th-century edition of the poem. Relevant lines from the poem are printed on facing pages and the complete text is also included. Admirers of Dor� will find ample evidence here of his characteristic ability to capture the mood and meaning of a work of literature in striking imagery; lovers of <i>The Raven</i> will delight in seeing its mournful musing on love and loss given dramatic pictorial form.<br>A selection of the Common Core State Standards Initiative.</p><p></p></p><p>French illustrator Gustave Dor� (1833-83) began his prolific career at the age of 15, and his dramatic engravings have exercised an incalculable influence over latter-day artists.

He lives in New London, New Hampshire.Gr. 2-4. DePaola picks up his autobiographical series right where his last title, <i>Things Will Never Be the Same</i> (2003),<i></i>left off: December, 7, 1941. Now in second grade, little Tomie describes the reactions to the Pearl Harbor bombings, first at home, then at church, and finally at school, where the children attend special assemblies and try to understand new concepts, such as air raids. What isn't explained fully at school, Tomie can ask about at home, and with his family's caring support, he is able to work through his fears about the war. Once again, the warm, childlike narration captures both the specifics of the time and universal experiences that will connect with most children. The shaded, black-and-white sketches on each page extend the story's small, revealing moments--stinky, wet wool mittens drying on the classroom radiator; Tomie snuggled into his grandfather's hug. Children won't recognize the war details, such as blackout curtains, but they'll see their own worries about today's conflicts and feel reassured about their safety, right along with Tomie. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The historian John Sugden charts the period of Nelson's career neglected by earlier writers-from childhood to his breathtaking victory against the Spanish fleet at Cape St. Vincent when he became an admiral, lost an arm, and won international fame. Like Alexander of Macedon, Nelson led from the front (not always a sensible custom). But he was a natural leader and a genuine hero, and his actions invariably raised his stock with his men, who trusted him as a commander willing to share their dangers.<br><br><i>Nelson </i>combines groundbreaking scholarship with a vivid and compelling narrative style. Detailing every facet of Nelson's crowded life, the author offers the only full account of Nelson's early voyages and the first complete analysis of the formative incidents in his career. Throughout there are revealing and startling discoveries about Nelson's relationships with family, patrons, officers, and men-and with his women. Previous biographies have failed to penetrate the mythology encrusting one of the world's greatest naval heroes, and none has been based on a thorough examination of original sources.<br> <br><i>Nelson</i> will immediately become the benchmark against which all subsequent books about Nelson will be judged. It is a biography of the best sort: compelling, authoritative, and thrillingly alive.<br></p><p><p>This compelling biography of Britain's greatest naval hero includes the only full reconstruction of Nelson's early voyages. Areas of his career are illuminated for the first time together with revealing discoveries about his personal and professional relationships.</p>John Sugden, historian and lecturer, has pursued his research for this work in archives in Europe, Britain, and North America over the past decade. His earlier books include biographies of Francis Drake and Tecumseh, the native American chief.

He testified before the National Commission on Space and assisted in writing its report.With his first book, White, a Boston systems-management consultant and writer for space journals, joins ranks with space-colonization evangelists Carl Sagan, Gerard K. O'Neill and their visionary ilk in presenting his theories on our space future. In his view, a new space movement is beginning, one which will require a philosophically grounded policy to drive it. Focusing less on emerging technology than on what he terms the Overview Effectthe paradigm shift experienced by astronauts who've responded deeply to the sight of Earth from spacehe here interviews 24 astronauts ranging from Yuri Gagarin and Alan Shepard to Sen. "Jake" Garn, who was a shuttle traveler before the Challenger tragedy. White sees space explorers as "explorer fish," venturing into space and, while creating new civilizations in three stages that he calls Terra, Solarius and Galaxie, furthering new growth in their own human evolution. A wild dreambut the author programs it provocatively within the bounds of science, letting it grow out of the awe he shows to be at the root of the Overview Effect. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>An Armory of Swords</h2><p>A slew of stories by various writers, including Walter Jon Williams, Robert E. Vardeman, and the editor himself, is set in the editor&#39;s popular Lost Swords universe, ruled by the Twelve Swords of Power.</p><p>Even readers unfamiliar with Saberhagen's Lost Swords series (The Last Book of Swords: Shieldbreaker's Story, etc.) will have no trouble following these stories written by a variety of authors and set in that saga's sword-and-sorcery universe. Saberhagen's "Blind Man's Blade" not only recapitulates the origin of the Swords (each of which is enchanted in its own way) but also sets up the premise for most of the remaining seven tales here. Each of the other writers, veterans (Walter Jon Williams, Michael A. Stackpole, Robert E. Vardemann) and relative newcomers (Pati Nagle, Gene Bostwick, Sage Walker, Thomas Saberhagen) alike, brings an individual perspective?but it's quickly apparent that many of the stories are uncomfortably similar to one another. In Bostwick's "Fealty," Vardemann's "Dragon Debt," Stackpole's "Luck of the Draw" and Thomas Saberhagen's "The Sword of Aren-Nath," for instance, the reader can end up rooting for bullies and braggarts who are at least honest about their intentions rather than for the ostensible heroes. Williams's "Woundhealer," however, deals with the Lost Swords on their own terms without compromising his usual storytelling excellence, while Nagle's "Glad Yule" and Walker's "Stealth and the Lady" would be worthy additions to any anthology. Even with its flaws, this collection is as interesting as most of the shared-world anthologies that seemed to glut the market just a few years ago. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ranging from Saberhagen's own tale of godly foolishness and mortal ingenuity ("Blind Man's Blade") to Michael Stackpole's swashbuckling adventure of two Swords in conflict ("Luck of the Draw"), this collection of eight original stories set in Saberhagen's "Lost Swords" universe explores these legendary weapons' mysterious pasts. Including stories by both veterans and newcomers to the genre, these tales of Coinspinner, Shieldbreaker, Woundhealer, and their companion blades will appeal to series followers as well as to the general fantasy audience.

He was both courageous and cultured. His passions were architecture, horses, and women. And, along with the whole courtly world of King Charles I and his cavaliers, he was doomed to failure. </p><p>Cavendish was a master of <i>man�ge</i> (the art of teaching horses to dance) and obsessed with building beautiful houses in the latest style. He taught Charles I's son to ride, and was the general of the king's army in the north during the Civil War. Famously defeated at the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644, he went into a long continental exile before returning to England in triumph on the restoration of King Charles II to the throne in 1660.</p><p>This is the story of one remarkable man, but it is also a rich evocation of what sustained him&#x2015;his extraordinary household.

The household's cacophony and stink as well as its ceremony and splendor come to life.</p></p><p><p>The Chief Curator of the Historic Royal Palaces (including Hampton Court and the Tower of London), <b>Lucy Worsley</b> is a leading young historian. She has been researching the story of William Cavendish and his household for more than ten years, and is the author of the English Heritage guide to Bolsover Castle, his principal home.</p>Worsley, the chief curator of Britain's Historic Royal Palaces, closely examines the life of 17th-century English aristocrat William Cavendish, a champion of poetry, music, horses, women and architecture, with reference to numerous primary sources including a rich body of his estate papers, letters and poems. Every detail of Cavendish's universe comes to life, from architect John Smithson's designs for his exquisite home to the job descriptions and diets of the building site's laborers. Also vividly described is a nasty household plot against Cavendish's much younger second wife and a costly entertainment staged by Cavendish to curry favor with Charles I. It succeeded, and the King made William earl, marquis, his heir's tutor and a Civil War general, a commission beyond Cavendish's abilities. After a key battle of the war ended in disaster, Cavendish fled to the continent, lived in relative poverty and was branded a coward, but his fortunes rebounded under Charles II, who minted him duke of Newcastle. Although fascinating, this diligently documented account reveals its roots as a doctoral thesis. 16-page color insert, b&amp;w illus. <i>(Oct. 20)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Entries on the objects follow, arranged by broad periods or themes (Tudor Renaissance, Sporting Life, the Highlands, etc.). Many of the objects are outstanding, but without any unifying theme this collection appears to be more successful as an exhibit than as a book with something overall to say. The color illustrations are very good, but the tone of the entries varies from author to author. Attractive, but not essential; prefer the works by Girouard or Luke Herrmann.

A love of baseball&#x2014;and, of course, the desire to whomp the neighboring town&#x2019;s team&#x2014;spurred on players and fans alike. The game was intense and personal, connecting people from all walks of life at every hard-fought game.Featuring individual stories of success and defeat, hundreds of photographs, and scores and statistics, Armand Peterson and Tom Tomashek chronicle the unfolding of a fascinating period of Minnesota baseball history&#x2014;a span of sixteen years beginning in 1945 and the euphoric postwar days to 1960, the year before the Washington Senators became the Minnesota Twins. During this time Minnesota experienced a magical era of amateur ball, setting records in town participation and attendance that have not been matched since.Along with the anecdotes, Town Ball offers an in-depth study of the era and examines the social and economic factors that contributed to the postwar boom and subsequent decline. It tells the stories of some of the more successful teams, such as Albert Lea, with five consecutive Class AA championships, and Warroad, a team with ten consecutive appearances&#x2014;but no trophies&#x2014;in the state tournament. And it includes profiles of many of the top players in Minnesota, famous locals like Dick Siebert, Paul Giel, and Bud Grant as well as the major-league talents of Bill Skowron, Herb Score, and Hilton Smith. Here nostalgic baseball enthusiasts and history buffs alike will revel in the wide-ranging stories and compelling portraits of the players and fans&#x2014;the people who made Minnesota town ball truly great. Armand Peterson is a retired engineer and a former town team player.Tom Tomashek is a retired sportswriter for the Wilmington News Journal and a former town team player.</p><p></p><h2>Sneezy the Snowman</h2><p>A snowman keeps doing things that make him melt, but the kids build him up again.</p><p>B-R-R-R-R!

I was supposed to be out jogging, but instead I was sitting at my breakfast table talking about men, sex, werewolves, vampires, and that thing that most unmarried but sexually active women fear most... <br><br> Anita Blake needs to be concentrating on a dangerous situation: the ardeur, the sexual power that flows between Anita and Jean-Claude, Master Vampire of the City, and Richard, the volatile werewolf who loves her passionately, is reaching new levels, perhaps evolving into something altogether new. The ardeur seems to be choosing new lovers for Anita, acting with a will of its own. As Jean-Claude says, the ardeur is hunting powerful prey. The unexpected effect of this is that Jean-Claude's own power as a master vampire has grown to new levels -- and Richard, never predictable, is changing too. <br><br> But as the days pass, Anita's less interested in vampire politics than in an ancient, ordinary dread she shares with women down the ages: she may be pregnant. And, if she is, whether the father is a vampire, a werewolf, or someone else entirely, she knows perfectly well that being a Federal Marshall, known for raising the dead and being a vampire executioner, is no way to bring up a baby...Laurell K.

Her death has shattered all alliances and left a power void that several ambitious clan chiefs see as their destiny to fill.

We must be vigilant.</i>OneRed Knot stopped where the palisade overlapped to form a protective entrance to Flat Pearl Village. Here, defenders could remain sheltered and shoot attacking warriors restricted in the narrow space between the posts. She stared nervously out into the morning, hesitant at stepping from the palisade's security. What she was doing wasn't wrong. She told herself that over and over.The sky had grayed with the new dawn and mist ghosted over the calm water in the inlet. To her right, the canoes down at the sandy landing were barely visible, their outlines blurred by the clinging haze. Above the canoe landing, the gardens lay fallow now, the corn and beans harvested from withered brown plants. Here and there, grass-thatched houses stood among the fields. Gentle streamers of blue smoke rose from the smoke holes in their roofs. Beyond the gardens, at the foot of the tree-covered ridge, the stubbly cornfields gave way to the thick forest.Red Knot glanced back at Flat Pearl Village. The longhouses, the House of the Dead, and the storage buildings stood silently in the gloom, their rounded shapes reminding her of hunchbacked monsters.Grandmother Hunting Hawk's brown-and-white dog watched her with pricked ears. Like her mistress, the animal was worn by the years, her joints swollen and painful. She hobbled a few paces and studied Red Knot with mild curiosity.Odd, Red Knot thought. Hunting Hawk usually kept the old bitch close to her bed on cool mornings like this. Why was the dog out wandering? With so many people in the village, perhaps the animal was just on edge.Red Knot studied the path she would have to take. Time was running out. She cocked her ear, listening. Not a sound came from the houses behind her, or from the predawn forest surrounding the village and its fields. Soon, however, the winter birds would begin to sing, and the village to stir. The honored guests would be fed before starting off.The guests--all had come to Flat Pearl Village in <i>her</i> honor. Red Knot clamped her jaw in determination. Echoes of her grandmother's endless lectures spun through her head. Honor. Duty. Respect. They blurred into meaningless words.<i>I owe something to myself. I can't be what they want me to be, go where they want me to go.</i> Memories of Copper Thunder's face haunted her. Even in relaxed moments, he looked more like a cunning witch than a man. If the thought of him even touching her brought a twist of revulsion to her stomach, how could she allow him to mount her? She might be Shell Comb's daughter, but the very thought of taking her rightful place and stepping into that tangled web sickened her.Her village, clan, and family--she was letting them all down. Red Knot closed her eyes, imagining the gray world around her, damp, cold, and misty. <i>Like everything else in my life.</i>She knotted her fist in the cloak that covered her shoulders, and slipped out of the palisade. Her moccasin-clad feet walked silently and swiftly, cutting across the frosted gardens. As she hurried, she could just see her breath in the half-light.The winter-bare trees along the riverbank lay no more than two bow shots ahead. Once she reached them, shewould have taken the first step toward freedom, and a brighter future.<i>I am a woman now.</i> The thought stuck in her mind. And, yes, she felt different--but oddly the same. Four days past, she'd stepped out of the Women's House, the menstrual lodge, for the first time. She had been ritually washed and decked out in resplendent finery. Her face still stung from the new tattoos on her chin and cheeks.In response to the runners who had been sent out at the onset of her cramps, guests had arrived from the surrounding villages. Speeches had been given, and gifts exchanged. Her clan had prepared a marvelous feast in her honor, the wooden dishes piled high with venison, duck, oysters, roasted corn, steaming tuckahoe, and smoked fish.To everyone's amazement, Copper Thunder, accompanied by four canoes of warriors, had arrived on the last day of the celebration.Red Knot had danced before him and the rest of the honored guests. Despite the presence of Copper Thunder, she had danced for young High Fox, her steps driven by desperation as his eyes gleamed for her.As she thought of him, her heart quickened. Now, or never, she had to take this one chance at happiness. What would happen, how it would all work out, she had no idea; but others had done as she was doing. They had become legendary among her passionate people. Their stories were sung in the Weroansqua's Great House. Perhaps, one day, songs would be sung about Red Knot and High Fox, and the love that had driven them to abandon their clans.She hurried through the trees, darting between the boles. To her right, water lapped at the sandy shore. To her left, she could see the dim haze of one of Hunting Hawk's cornfields. Once past that, she would head left,skirting the cleared land, and climb the steep ridge on the old deer trail.<i>"I'll be waiting at Oyster Shell Landing."</i> High Fox's words echoed. His solemn eyes haunted her, his handsome face radiating love. <i>"Meet me at first light."</i>No, this wasn't wrong. Not in the eyes of the gods. They only reacted in rage over lying, murder, or that most horrible of crimes, incest.She ran, feet pattering on the damp leaf mat. Over the years all the fallen branches had been scavenged for cooking fires, so she need only worry about roots that might trip her.She almost missed the trail, but, heart beating, she sprinted up the steep winding path, her breath beginning to labor. The white-tailed deer had originally forged this route down to the cornfields, but they ran it no longer. Her people had all but hunted them out on the narrow neck of land surrounding the village. Now, only occasional deer raided the fields, and they did so at risk of an arrow. Was it not better to have the deer in the people's belly than their corn in the deer's?She panted up the ridge, and thanked the Spirits that they had granted this warm spell and held off the snow that would have betrayed her tracks. Her toes drove into the soft, mulched soil.When she reached the great beech tree, its smooth bark marred by the years, she stopped to catch her breath. Six men would have to stretch fingertip to fingertip to reach around the tree's circumference. She stepped past the beech, out onto the rounded ridgetop, into the shade of the other forest giants. A robin chirped in the high canopy of bare branches, and a squirrel skittered across the fallen leaves.Morning was coming. She had to hurry.Red Knot took a deep breath, and started forward. Shehad only to cross the ridgetop, then descend the steep path on the other side to the--"Just as I thought," a familiar voice called from behind her. "It's all in the blood."Red Knot spun, gasping, the worst of her fears suddenly realized, as a blanket-wrapped figure stepped from the deep morning shadows behind a walnut tree. "What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in your ..."The blanketed assailant moved with uncanny speed. Red Knot glimpsed the war club, heard it whistle as it sliced the air ... .The loud crack of breaking bone echoed across the quiet misty hills.Copyright � 1997 by Kathleen O'Neal Gear and W.

He went on to write seventy-five Maigret novels and twenty-eight Maigret short stories.<b>1. Nobody&#x2019;s Dog</b><p>Friday, 7 November. Concarneau is empty. The lighted clock in the Old Town glows above the ramparts; it is five minutes to eleven.</p><p>The tide is in, and a south-westerly gale is slamming the boats together in the harbour. The wind surges through the streets. Here and there a scrap of paper scuttles swiftly along the ground.</p><p>There is not a single light on Quai de l&#x2019;Aiguillon. Everything is closed. Everyone is asleep. Only the three windows of the Admiral Hotel, on the square where it meets the quay, are still lighted.</p><p>They have no shutters, but through their murky greenish panes the figures inside are just barely visible. Huddled in his booth less than a hundred metres away, the customs guard stares enviously at the people lingering in the caf�.</p><p>Across from him in the harbour is a coaster that had come in for shelter that afternoon. There is no one on deck. Its blocks creak, and a loose jib snaps in the wind. And there is the relentless din of the gale and the rattle of the tower clock as it prepares to toll eleven.</p><p>The hotel door opens. A man appears, still talking to the people inside. The gale snatches at him, flaps his coat-tails, lifts off his bowler hat. He catches it in time and jams it on his head as he walks away.</p><p>Even from a distance, it is clear that he is a bit tipsy; he is unsteady on his legs and is humming a tune. The customs guard watches him and grins when the man decides to light a cigar. A comic struggle then develops between the drunk and the wind, which tears at his coat and his hat as it pushes him along the pavement. Ten matches are blown out.</p><p>The man spots a doorway up two steps, takes cover there and leans forwards. A match flickers, very briefly. The smoker staggers, grabs for the doorknob.</p><p>Was that noise part of the storm, the customs guard wonders. He can&#x2019;t be sure. He laughs as he sees the fellow lose his balance and reel backwards at an impossible angle.</p><p>The man lands on the ground at the kerb, his head in the filth of the gutter. The customs guard beats his hands against his sides to warm them and scowls at the jib, irritated by its racket.</p><p>A minute, two minutes pass. He takes another glance at the drunk, who has not moved. A dog has turned up from somewhere and is sniffing at him.</p><p>&#x2018;That was when I first got the feeling there was something wrong,&#x2019; the customs guard said later, at the hearing.</p><p>The comings and goings that followed are harder to establish in strict chronological order. The customs guard approaches the fallen man, not reassured by the presence of the dog, a big snarling yellow animal. There is a street lamp eight or ten metres away. At first he sees nothing unusual. Then he notices a hole in the drunk&#x2019;s overcoat and a thick fluid flowing from the hole.</p><p>He runs to the Admiral Hotel. The caf� is nearly empty. Leaning on the till is a waitress. At a marble table, two men, their chairs tilted back, their legs stretched out, are finishing their cigars.</p><p>&#x2018;Quick! A crime ... I don&#x2019;t know ...&#x2019;</p><p>The customs guard looks down. The yellow dog has followed him in and is lying at the waitress&#x2019;s feet.</p><p>There is hesitation, a vague feeling of fright in the air.</p><p>&#x2018;Your friend, the man who just left here ...&#x2019;</p><p>Some seconds later, the three of them are leaning over the body, still sprawled at the kerb. A few steps away is the town hall, with the police station. The customs guard, needing to do something, dashes over and then, breathless, runs to a doctor&#x2019;s doorbell.</p><p>Unable to shake off the sight, he keeps repeating, &#x2018;He staggered backwards like a drunk, and he went three or four steps, like this ...&#x2019;</p><p>Five men, then six, seven. Windows opening everywhere. Whispering ...</p><p>On his knees in the mud, the doctor declares: &#x2018;A bullet fired point-blank into the belly. He must be operated on right away. Someone phone the hospital!&#x2019;</p><p>Everyone recognizes the wounded man. It is Monsieur Mostaguen, Concarneau&#x2019;s biggest wine dealer, a good fellow, without an enemy in the world.</p><p>The two uniformed policemen &#x2013; one of them has come out without his cap &#x2013; don&#x2019;t know where to begin the investigation.</p><p>Someone is talking: Monsieur Le Pommeret, whose manner and voice show him to be someone important. &#x2018;He and I were playing cards at the Admiral caf�, with Servi�res and Dr Michoux. The doctor left first, half an hour ago. And then Mostaguen ... He&#x2019;s afraid of his wife; he left on the stroke of eleven ...&#x2019;</p><p>A tragicomedy: everyone is listening to Monsieur Le Pommeret; they have forgotten about the wounded man.Suddenly he opens his eyes, tries to get up, and, in a voice so surprised, so gentle, so feeble that the waitress bursts into nervous laughter, he whispers, &#x2018;What happened?&#x2019;</p><p>But a spasm of pain racks him. His lips twist. The muscles of his face tighten as the doctor prepares his syringe for a shot.</p><p>The yellow dog circles among the many legs. Puzzled, someone asks, &#x2018;You know this animal?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ve never seen him before.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Probably off some boat.&#x2019;</p><p>In the charged atmosphere, the dog is troubling. Perhaps it is his colour, a dirty yellow. He&#x2019;s tall and lanky, very thin, and his huge head calls to mind both a mastiff and a bulldog.</p><p>Five or six metres away, the policemen are questioning the customs guard, who is the only witness.</p><p>They look at the doorstep. It is the entrance to a large private house, whose shutters are closed. To the right of the door, a solicitor&#x2019;s sign announces the sale of the building at auction on 18 November: Reserve price: 80,000 francs.</p><p>A policeman fiddles for a long while without managing to force the lock. Finally, the owner of the garage next door cracks it with a screwdriver.</p><p>The ambulance arrives. Monsieur Mostaguen is lifted on to a stretcher. The onlookers are left with nothing to do but contemplate the empty house.</p><p>It has stood empty for a year now. A heavy smell of gunpowder and tobacco hangs in the hallway. A torch beam picks out cigarette ashes and muddy tracks on the flagstone floor, indicating that someone had been waiting and watching for a good while behind the door.</p><p>A man wearing only a coat over his pyjamas says to his wife, &#x2018;Come on! There&#x2019;s nothing more to see. We&#x2019;ll find out the rest from the paper tomorrow. Monsieur Servi�res is here ...&#x2019;</p><p>Servi�res, a plump little man in a raincoat, had been with Monsieur Le Pommeret at the Admiral. He is an editor at the Brest Beacon, and, in addition, writes a humorous piece every Sunday.</p><p>He is taking notes, giving suggestions &#x2013; not to say orders &#x2013; to the two policemen.</p><p>The doors along the hallway are locked. The one at the rear, which opens on to the garden, is swinging open. The garden is surrounded by a wall no higher than a metre and a half. Beyond the wall is an alley that runs into Quai de l&#x2019;Aiguillon.</p><p>&#x2018;The murderer went out that way!&#x2019; proclaims Jean Servi�res.</p><p>It was on the following day that Maigret established this rough account of the event. For the past month he had been assigned to Rennes to reorganize its mobile unit. There he had received an agitated phone call from the mayor of Concarneau.</p><p>And he had come to the town with Leroy, an inspector with whom he had not worked before.</p><p>The storm never let up. Heavy clouds dropped icy rain over the town. No boats left port, and there was talk of a steamer in distress out past the Gl�nan Islands.</p><p>Of course, Maigret installed himself at the Admiral Hotel, the best in town. It was five in the afternoon and just dark when he stepped into the caf�, a long, gloomy room with marble tables and sawdust scattered on the dingy floor. The room was made drearier still by the green windowpanes.</p><p>Several tables were occupied. But a quick survey was enough to tell him which was the one with the regulars, the established customers, whose conversation everyone else tried to overhear.</p><p>Someone rose from that table &#x2013; a baby-faced man with round eyes and a smile on his lips.</p><p>&#x2018;Inspector Maigret? My good friend the mayor told me you were coming ... I&#x2019;ve heard a lot about you. Let me introduce myself: Jean Servi�res ... Well, now &#x2013; you&#x2019;re from Paris, I believe? So am I! I was manager of the Red Cow in Montmartre for some time; I&#x2019;ve worked for the Petit Parisien, for Excelsior, for the Dispatch ... I was a close friend of one of your chiefs &#x2013; Bertrand, a fine fellow. He retired to the country last year, down in Ni�vre. And I&#x2019;ve done the same thing: I&#x2019;ve retired, so to speak, from public life ...

He captures, verse by verse, the essence of this ancient philosophical poem which debates eternal questions of right and wrong, action and consequence, and the conflicting nature of duty and love. The text stands by itself, complete and without interpolation, juxtaposed with the Sanskrit for easy reference; interpretation and explanation are tucked away as notes at the end.

He makes these practices accessible to Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike, showing how our very suffering can be the path to our liberation.</p><p>What should we think when on the one hand Buddhism tells us that life is suffering and on the other we are told to enjoy life's every moment? Loved around the world for his simple, straightforward explanations of Buddhism, Thich Nhat Hanh has finally turned his hand to the very core of Buddhism and conundrums such as this. In the traditional way, Thich Nhat Hanh takes up the core teachings one by one--the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, the Twelve Links of Interdependent Co-Arising--but his approach is as fresh as a soft breeze through a plum orchard. For illustration, he dips into the vast stores of Buddhist literature right alongside contemporary anecdotes, pointing out subtleties that can get glossed over in other popular introductions. He also includes three short but key sutras, essential source teachings from which all Buddhism flows. Studying the basics of Buddhism under Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh is like learning basketball from Michael Jordan. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Heart of the Buddha's Teaching, Thich Nhat Hanh introduces us to the core teachings of Buddhism and shows us that the Buddha's teachings are accessible and applicable to our daily lives. With poetry and clarity, Nhat Hanh imparts comforting wisdom about the nature of suffering and its role in creating compassion, love, and joy--all qualities of enlightenment. Covering such significant teachings as the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, the Three Doors of Liberation, the Three Dharma Seals, and the Seven Factors of Awakening, <b>The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching</b> is a radiant beacon on Buddhist thought for the initiated and uninitiated alike.</p><h2>Chocolate from the Cake Mix Doctor</h2><p>The Cake Mix Doctor goes chocolate! Anne Byrn brings her proven prescription for doctoring cake mix to an ingredient that inspires love bordering on obsession.<p> It's a marriage made in baker's heaven-150 all-new, all-easy recipes for cakes, starring the ingredient that surpasses all other flavors, including vanilla, by a 3-to-1 margin, and that Americans consume to the tune of 2.8 billion pounds a year. Starting with versatile supermarket cake mixes and adding just the right extras-including melted semisweet chocolate bars, chocolate chips, or cocoa powder, plus fresh eggs or a bit of buttermilk, dried coconut, mashed bananas, or instant coffee powder-a baker at any level of experience can turn out dark, rich, moist, delicious chocolate layer cakes, time and again. Not to mention sheet cakes, pound cakes, cupcakes and muffins, cheesecakes, cookies, brownies, and bars. Rounding out the book are 38 all-new homemade frostings and fillings, and a full-color insert showing every cake in the book.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p>Ann Byrn is on to something. Her first book, <i>The Cake Mix Doctor</i>, showed readers how to tweak store-bought cake mixes to produce "like-homemade" treats. The sequel, <i>Chocolate from the Cake Mix Doctor</i> repeats Byrn's foolproof approach, focusing solely on chocolate. The strategy? Begin with commercial mixes like chocolate cake, devil's food, and chocolate brownie; alter them with ingredients that add flavor, such as cocoa powder, or richness and moistness, like sour cream; use homemade frostings (supermarket versions won't cut it); and you're in business. "My mission," says Byrn, "is to help busy cooks find the time to bake even when company is <i>not</i> coming." If her sweets lack true homemade quality, they nonetheless produce entirely creditable desserts most bakers, and those they feed, will applaud.<p> Beginning with a blueprint for mix-doctoring success, which includes information on pantry essentials and a useful chocolate primer, the book then presents over 150 easy recipes for a full range of chocolate layer, pound, sheet, angel food, and chiffon cakes, as well as muffins, cookies, brownies, and more. Among these, readers will surely want to try Triple Decker Raspberry Chocolate Cake, White Chocolate Peach Cake, Frozen Chocolate Neapolitan Cake, and Jessica's Caramel Chocolate Brownies. Besides more basic finishes, the frosting chapter offers recipes for the likes of Crushed Peppermint Buttercream Frosting.

There followed a &#39;terror-famine&#39;, inflicted on the collectivised peasants of the Ukraine and certain other regions by the state, which set impossibly high quotas, removed every other source of food, and prevented outside help - even from other areas of the USSR - from reaching the starving millions.

Here award-winning author Myra MacPherson deconstructs and lays bare the manners and mores of Victorian America, remarkably illuminating the struggle for equality that women are still fighting today.</b></i><i><br></i>Victoria Woodhull and Tennessee "Tennie" Claflin-the most fascinating and scandalous sisters in American history-were unequaled for their vastly avant-garde crusade for women's fiscal, political, and sexual independence. They escaped a tawdry childhood to become rich and famous, achieving a stunning list of firsts. In 1870 they became the first women to open a brokerage firm, not to be repeated for nearly a century. Amid high gossip that he was Tennie's lover, the richest man in America, fabled tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt, bankrolled the sisters. As beautiful as they were audacious, the sisters drew a crowd of more than two thousand Wall Street bankers on opening day. A half century before women could vote, Victoria used her Wall Street fame to become the first woman to run for president, choosing former slave Frederick Douglass as her running mate. She was also the first woman to address a United States congressional committee. Tennie ran for Congress and shocked the world by becoming the honorary colonel of a black regiment.<br>They were the first female publishers of a radical weekly, and the first to print Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto in America. As free lovers they railed against Victorian hypocrisy and exposed the alleged adultery of Henry Ward Beecher, the most famous preacher in America, igniting the "Trial of the Century" that rivaled the Civil War for media coverage. Eventually banished from the women's movement while imprisoned for allegedly sending "obscenity" through the mail, the sisters sashayed to London and married two of the richest men in England, dining with royalty while pushing for women's rights well into the twentieth century. Vividly telling their story, Myra MacPherson brings these inspiring and outrageous sisters brilliantly to life. <br></p><p>Myra MacPherson is the award-winning and bestselling author of four previous books, including <i>The Power Lovers,</i> the Vietnam War classic <i>Long Time Passing</i>, and <i>All Governments Lie</i>.

Contacted by an aged relative with whom he'd long lost touch, Brady agrees to help his Uncle Moze with a sensitive family matter. Having received a diagnosis of terminal cancer, Moze is looking to mend fences with his only daughter. But the daughter seems to have simply disappeared, leaving no clues or hints as to her whereabouts. As Brady tackles the seemingly impossible task of finding his cousin - a case that looks less and less like a simple missing person case - it becomes clear that whatever is going on now is related to a dark, undiscussed episode in his family's past: the brutal, still unsolved murder of another of Brady's uncles.</p></p><p><p><b>William G. Tapply</b> was the author of numerous works of fiction and nonfiction, including the Brady Coyne novels as well as the mystery <i>Bitch Creek</i>. He lived in Hancock, New Hampshire.</p>NERVOUS WATER (Chapter One)One <p>The end of a muggy Thursday afternoon in early July. Thunder grumbled from the direction of the western suburbs, and the air hung still and heavy and moist over the city.</p> <p>I'd shucked off my courtroom pinstripe, slipped into a pair of cutoffs and a T-shirt, and made myself a tall gin and tonic, and I was sitting in one of the Adirondack chairs in the walled-in patio behind our town house on Mount Vernon Street reading the Globe sports section and waiting for Evie to come home.</p> <p>Henry David Thoreau, our middle-aged Brittany spaniel, lay under the picnic table with his chin on his paws eyeing a pair of evening grosbeaks, which were jabbing at sunflower seeds on one of the hanging birdfeeders.</p> <p>I'd finished my drink and was pondering a refill when I heard the kitchen phone ring. I figured it was Evie. She was a little late.</p> <p>When I stood up, the grosbeaks burst away in a bright flash of yellow and black.</p> <p>"Sorry about that," I said to Henry, who'd lifted his head and was frowning at me. Brittanies are bird dogs. Their genes carry the powerful instinct to point grouse and woodcock and quail for the hunter. Poor Henry, the city dog, had to be satisfied with grosbeaks and finches and titmice.</p> <p>When I answered the phone, a gravelly voice said, "Hey, sonnyboy."</p> <p>Only one person ever called me "sonnyboy." I hadn't heard that voice for over thirty years. But I recognized it instantly.</p> <p>"Moses Crandall," I said. "Jesus Christ. What's up, Uncle Moze?"</p> <p>"Just wonderin' how you'd feel about helping me haul my pots." I heard him take a wet drag on a cigarette. "Maybe go fishin' afterwards. Stripers're in the river. Gittin' some blues, too. They ain't gonna hang around much longer."</p> <p>"Is everything all right?" I said.</p> <p>"Why the hell wouldn't it be?"</p> <p>"Well, okay, good," I said. "When did you have in mind?"</p> <p>"Saturday okay with you?" he said. "Git here around noon, we'll catch the turn of the tide."</p> <p>"I'll be there," I said. "Your boat still moored in the same place?"</p> <p>"Same river, same mooring, same boat," he said. "Mostly the same string of pots. Nothin' much changes, sonnyboy. We just keep gittin' older. See you then."</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I was back out in the Adirondack chair when Evie came out through the back door a half hour later. She bent down, hooked her forearm around the back of my neck, and gave me a long juicy kiss on the mouth.</p> <p>She'd snagged a bottle of beer from the refrigerator on her way through the kitchen. She flopped down in the chair beside me, pried off her high heels, propped her feet up on the table's bench seat, hiked her skirt up to the tops of her thighs, and pressed the bottle against her cheek. "Hot one, huh?" she said.</p> <p>"It's not so much the heat--"</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah," she said, "it's the damn humidity," completing the hoary New England clich�.</p> <p>"Thunderstorm brewing," I said. "You can smell it."</p> <p>She looked up at the sky, where dark clouds were roiling. "No doubt," she said. "I love thunderstorms."</p> <p>"Tough day?"</p> <p>"Budget crap." She waved the subject of budget crap away with the back of her hand. Evie was an administrator at Beth Israel Hospital. She worked a lot harder than I did. "How 'bout you?"</p> <p>"I had the MacPherson suit today. We settled in the lobby a half hour before the hearing."</p> <p>"That's good, huh?"</p> <p>"This time it was." I took a sip of gin and tonic. The grosbeaks had not returned, but a couple of chickadees were flitting back and forth between the lilac bush and the feeder with sunflower seeds in their beaks, and three or four goldfinches were perched on the thistle-seed feeder.</p> <p>Henry had taken up a position beside Evie's chair and was pretending to ignore the birds. Evie's arm dangled down and she was scratching the top of his head. She was slouched in the chair with her eyes closed.</p> <p>"Looks like I'll be heading up to Maine on Saturday," I said.</p> <p>"What's up?"</p> <p>"I got a call from my uncle. Uncle Moze. Moses Crandall. My mother's brother. Lives in Moulton, just over the New Hampshire border. He wants me to go out on his boat with him, help him tend his lobster pots. Maybe we'll try to catch a striper."</p> <p>"Sounds like fun." Evie took a sip of beer and looked at me over the bottle. "I don't remember you ever mentioning your uncle Moses."</p> <p>"I haven't seen him for over thirty years. When I was a kid Uncle Moze used to take me out on his lobster boat. He was my favorite uncle."</p> <p>She looked up at the sky. The dark clouds were thickening, and the air had become noticeably cooler. "I think you're right about the thunderstorm."</p> <p>I smiled. "Of course I'm right."</p> <p>After a few minutes of comfortable silence, Evie said, "So why now?"</p> <p>"Hmm?"</p> <p>"Why after--what, thirty-odd years?--why is it today that your uncle invites you to go lobster fishing?"</p> <p>"That," I said, "is the question. Did I ever tell you about when I was a kid and we found my Uncle Norman's body floating in the river?"</p> <p>"You never talk about your childhood, Brady."</p> <p>"Well, what do you want to know?"</p> <p>"Everything."</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>My mother grew up in the village of Moulton on the estuary of the Piscataqua River in southernmost Maine. Her name was Hope. Jacob and Moses were her older brothers. Uncle Jake and Uncle Moze.</p> <p>My mother had three sisters. Faith, Charity, and Mary. Mary was the baby of the family. My grandparents apparently ran out of virtues by the time they got to Mary, so they named her after a virgin, which turned out to be pretty ironic.</p> <p>Gram Crandall had white hair and a large bosom and smelled like violets. She is, in my memory, a kind of mythic presence, sweet and gentle and beloved by everybody. I associate her primarily with the aroma of corn chowder and warm apple pie and boiled new red potatoes doused in butter and sprinkled with parsley.</p> <p>My grandfather worked for the paper company running pulp on the Kennebec River. He died in some kind of accident when I was four or five. I have no memory of him.</p> <p>My mother was the only one in the Crandall family who actually left home. Her sisters married local boys and settled right there in Moulton. Her brothers chased the local version of the American Dream, which was owning their own lobster boats.</p> <p>My mother was the rebel. She went to college in Massachusetts, taught seventh-grade English, and married Alan Coyne, who was a lawyer with a big firm on State Street.</p> <p>All of that made my family members objects of awe and suspicion among my aunts and uncles and cousins and their neighbors in Moulton, Maine, and probably accounted for the fact that we didn't visit Gram Crandall more often.</p> <p>Except for Mary and Moses--Uncle Moze--I didn't know my aunts and uncles very well. Faith and Charity were younger, more nervous, less loving versions of my grandmother. Uncle Jake pretty much ignored me whenever he was around.</p> <p>Uncle Moze was my favorite. He was strong and independent and profane, the closest thing to a New England cowboy that you'd meet in those times thirty-odd years ago. He was the only uncle who paid any attention to me, actually. He seemed to enjoy having me on his boat, maybe because he didn't have kids of his own. Uncle Moze gave the impression of being taciturn, but when he was in the mood, he loved to tell long, ironic stories. They involved colorful Maine characters he'd presumably known--poachers and drunks and adulterers, mostly--and it flattered me that he didn't censor his stories because I happened to be there.</p> <p>To me, going lobstering with Uncle Moze was another kind of fishing. We chugged around the broad tidal river spewing diesel fumes, and he and my old man snagged the buoys with the boat hook, looped the thick line around the power winch, and hauled up the pots.</p> <p>I liked anticipating what we might find inside the big wooden lobster pots. It wasn't that different from seeing my bobber start to jiggle on my neighborhood millpond back in Massachusetts and wondering what kind of fish might've eaten my worm. I was seriously hooked on fishing of all kinds when I was a kid.</p> <p>In those days, lobsters were abundant, and Uncle Moze's pots generally came up crawling with them. He wore rubber gloves that came up to his elbows, and he groped around inside the pot, came out grasping a lobster around its middle, and quickly measured it with his steel lobster ruler. He threw the shorts overboard. The keepers went into tubs filled with seaweed--those with both claws, which Uncle Moze sold to a wholesaler in Kittery, in one tub, and the unsalable ones with a missing or deformed claw, which he kept for himself or gave to Gram, in the other.</p> <p>My job was rebaiting the pots. For bait Uncle Moze used pollock and haddock minus their fillets but with the heads still attached that he got cheap from the wholesaler he sold his lobsters to. I liked digging my hands around in the tub of smelly fish skeletons and stabbing them through their eye sockets onto the metal hooks inside the wooden pots. I liked how I smelled fishy for several days afterward.</p> <p>Most of all, I liked the fact that Uncle Moze, unlike my old man, made me feel useful.</p> <p>That's why he was my favorite uncle.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Two months after we found Uncle Norman floating in the Piscataqua River, Aunt Mary gave birth to a girl. She turned the baby over to Uncle Moze and his wife, a quiet little woman named Lillian who, my mother once told me, couldn't have children. It was Lillian and Moze, not Aunt Mary, her actual mother, who named the baby Cassandra.</p> <p>Aunt Mary lived with my grandmother until the following spring, when she hooked up with a boy from Portland who'd just been drafted by the Detroit Tigers. She followed him to someplace in Iowa where he'd been assigned to a minor-league team, and that was the last I heard of Aunt Mary.</p> <p>Cassandra, her baby, stayed in Moulton, Maine, with Uncle Moze and Aunt Lillian.</p> <p>My grandmother moved to Florida a year or two later, and after that my family stopped going to Moulton, and I pretty much lost track of the Crandall side of my family.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>They never did figure out who plugged Uncle Norman in the forehead. They questioned a lot of people, but nobody had seen anything or had much to say. Forensics, such as they were, weren't much help. His body had been in the water for quite a while.</p> <p>Or maybe they just didn't try very hard. Nobody had much tolerance for a beer-bellied drunk who'd break his pregnant wife's arm and punch her face and kick her out of their trailer.</p> <p>Anyway, it turned out that Norman Dillman had plenty of enemies. He'd been transporting more than lobsters and fish on the boat he kept moored over in Kittery, and he owed a lot of money to some shady people in Boston.</p> <p>The consensus in the Crandall family was that all in all, things hadn't turned out so bad.</p> <p>NERVOUS WATER Copyright � 2005 by William G.

In opera, there was the unsurpassed Maria Callas. In jazz, the tormented Billie Holiday. And in country music, there was Tammy Wynette.<br><br> "Stand by Your Man," "D-I-V-O-R-C-E," "Take Me to Your World" are but a few highlights of Tammy's staggering musical legacy, all sung with a voice that became the touchtone for women's vulnerability, disillusionment, strength, and endurance.<br><br> In <i>Tammy Wynette</i>, bestselling biographer Jimmy McDonough tells the story of the small-town girl who grew up to be the woman behind the microphone, whose meteoric rise led to a decades-long career full of tragedy and triumph. Through a high-profile marriage and divorce, her dreadful battle with addiction and illness, and the struggle to compete in a rapidly evolving Nashville, Tammy turned a brave smile toward the world and churned out masterful hit songs though her life resembled the most heartbreaking among them.<br><br> <i>Tammy Wynette</i> is an intimate portrait of a music icon, the Queen of Heartbreak, whose powerful voice simultaneously evoked universal pain and longing even as it belied her own.<br></p><p><strong>A Conversation with Author Jimmy McDonough</strong> <br> <br> Can we get a hamburger? <br> <br> <b> No, Jimmy, we have to discuss your new book. </b> <br> <br> Oh, right, this is where the author toots his own horn for a few pages. Well, I already tooted the horn for close to 400 pages. The horn is tired. The horn is flaccid. <br> <br> <b> Thank you for that lovely image, Jimmy, but let&#x2019;s get to business: why Tammy Wynette? </b> <br> <br> Why Tammy? I&#x2019;ll tell you why. Wynette&#x2019;s one of the greatest singers this country has ever produced, yet you never hear about her. Tammy&#x2019;s taken for granted. And if you do her about her, it&#x2019;s because of her anthem, &#x201c;Stand By Your Man.&#x201d; Some people never got past that one. They assume Tammy is just some sort of one-dimensional anti-feminist mouthpiece. She&#x2019;s much more complex than people give her credit for. Until illness and drug addiction sidelined her, Tammy was very, very independent. She sold millions of records and changed the game for female country singers. Madonna? Lady Gaga? Wynette created that kind of frenzy back in the sixties/seventies, only with a steel guitar. She sang for five presidents, and was known to smooch both Ronald Reagan and George Wallace on lips after belting one out for their benefit. Among her fans you&#x2019;ll find diverse artists as Loretta Lynn, Elton John, Tanya Tucker, Sting, Faith Hill and James Taylor. &#x201c;One of the greatest voices of all time,&#x201d; says Dolly Parton. <br> <br> This is a woman who overcame many obstacles. Nashville potentates told Tammy she&#x2019;d never make it; door after door was slammed in her face. Her mother Mildred fought her every step of the way&#x2014;only to wind up running her daughter&#x2019;s fan club once Wynette became a star. Tammy came from out of nowhere, a divorcee with three kids, and absolutely conquered Music City. &#x201c;She went from bein&#x2019; a beautician to the queen of country music,&#x201d; notes Emmylou Harris. <br> <br> I must admit, I have been a fan of Tammy&#x2019;s most of my life. I always thought I&#x2019;d write about her someday. I give all to my books&#x2014;this isn&#x2019;t just a gig for me&#x2014;and I can only write about people I deeply admire. I like Tammy even more now than before I started the book&#x2014;which isn&#x2019;t always the case, heh heh. So this book was a labor of love. <br> <br> <b> Give us five words to describe Tammy Wynette. </b> <br> <br> Regal, single-minded, conflicted, elusive, haunted. <br> <br> <b> What did you come to admire about Wynette the most? </b> <br> <br> She was definitely a larger-than-life character, just as extreme as any of her male counterparts. As was her music. &#x201c;I believe you have to live the songs,&#x201d; insisted Wynette. Tammy took the romantic country ballad and just drove it into the ground. One sad song after another&#x2014;after another! She was unrelenting. Even at the end of her life when she practically had to crawl onstage to sing, Tammy refused to give up. I love that. <br> <br> <b> Of course, there have been two books on Wynette already. </b> <br> <br> Yes, there have, but neither offer the complete story. The first was her autobiography, <i>Stand By Your Man</i>, in which author Joan Dew captures Tammy&#x2019;s voice brilliantly. That book was one of the reasons I became a writer. But it&#x2019;s only Tammy&#x2019;s side of the story, and it ends in the seventies, before her life got truly weird. The other book was written directly after Tammy&#x2019;s death by her daughter Jackie (with Tom Carter), and is basically an indictment of Wynette&#x2019;s final husband, George Richey. <br> <br> So Tammy&#x2019;s never gotten a proper biography. Many of the people I interviewed&#x2014;her friends, band members, hairdressers, childhood playmates&#x2014;have never spoken publicly before. And some of them were so unsettled by her death it took until now for them to talk. <br> <br> Tammy was much more eccentric than people think. She had a passion for clip-on earrings and a strong dislike for feminine hygiene commercials. She could be extremely generous and very vindictive. She had a wry, observant sense of humor and admitted to smoking the occasional joint. Tammy got to people&#x2014;I&#x2019;m talking as a person, not as a singer&#x2014;on a very deep level, yet she wasn&#x2019;t one to expose her feelings in any sort of direct way. There is many a riddle to this lady and, despite four years of intense research, still so much I can&#x2019;t explain. <br> <br> <b> What&#x2019;s the most surprising thing you learned researching her life? </b> <br> <br> Well, Tammy liked to embellish. Not maliciously, for the most part&#x2014;she&#x2019;d just get excited and add details to spice things up. She was a teller of tall tales. So much so that when her autobiography came out, co-author Joan Dew, to pass the time, would quiz her on the contents while out on the road. &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t know the answers,&#x201d; admitted Dew. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;d ever read the book.&#x201d; <br> <br> The other thing that was surprised me was how reticent Wynette was to spill the beans to friends and family. In interviews and performances Tammy seemed so open and forthcoming, but in private she wasn&#x2019;t exactly an open book. That&#x2019;s why this biography is important&#x2014;you get a much fuller picture from those closest to her than she would ever revealed herself. <br> <br> <b> Read the full interview </b>Jimmy McDonough&#x2019;s biography of Neil Young, <i>Shakey</i>, was a critically acclaimed <i>New York Times</i> bestseller.

Both of Bernstein's parents had Communist Party affiliations in the 1940s. His father, Al, a Senate-appointed investigative attorney on Capitol Hill, later a union leader in San Francisco, attended a few Party meetings; his mother, Sylvia, participated in the party's campaigns on behalf of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg and to desegregate swimming pools. When Truman's loyalty boards began passing judgment, in 1947, on government employees' fitness to serve, Al Bernstein was defense counsel in some 500 such cases. His own union career derailed, he opened a laundry. In 1954, his wife was called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. The FBI was a constant presence in their son's boyhood and adolescence. This taut memoir mingles pride, angry confrontation with the author's parents and coming to terms with the past. We also get unbuttoned glimpses of the author as fourth-grade "patriotic nut," Bar Mitzvah boy screaming at his "atheistic" mom and dad, brash fraternity leader in Maryland's suburbs, budding journalist.

Among them, <i>Barbara Tropp's the Modern Art of Chinese Cooking</i> stands out for its grounding in the underlying philosophy of this sophisticated cuisine. Tropp explores the yin and yang, the harmony of opposites underlying all aspects of Chinese life. Relating them particularly to cooking, she illustrates how seasoning with both chiles and sugar gives a dish fullness of flavor that is more than just hot and sweet. The author gives much attention to equipment and techniques--this is an in-depth manual as well a recipe book. Ever practical, she is not too shy to advise readers about using a Western-style skillet for stir frying, along with advice on using woks, cleavers, and steamers.<p> The recipe section opens with assorted nibbles. Dishes range from spicy Szechuan Ma-La Cold Chicken to Rice-Coated Pork Pearl Balls, ideal for serving at parties. There are red-cooked stewed meats and juicy Pot Sticker Dumplings. Recipes are as simple as Spinach Stir-Fried with Garlic and Salt, and as complex as Pressed Birthday Duck, which takes up to four days to make and involves three cooking techniques. The dishes come from various regions of China, with an emphasis on those with bold flavors. Tropp adds technique notes to her already detailed instructions, and even recommends what serving dishes to use, whether to heat them, and the best wines to accompany dishes.</p><p> Ultimately, the wealth of information, Tropp's charming voice, and the creative touches she adds in crunchy Cinnamon Bark Chicken, Ginger-Infused Cr�me Caramel and other recipes make <i>Barbara Tropp's The Modern Art of Chinese Cooking</i> a necessary book for anyone serious about Chinese food. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p>Hailed as a culinary classic when it first appeared years ago in hardcover, it's a pleasure to see the paperback version, which will reach new audiences with its hundreds of recipes and insights on Chinese cooking techniques. Many menu suggestions and notes on techniques are included in this comprehensive guide. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Pinktoes</h2><p>A sex farce deemed to be Himes&#x2019;s most daring work of fiction</p><p></p><h2>Prescription for Nutritional Healing: The A-to-Z Guide to Supplements</h2><p><b>A convenient, pocket-sized guide to today's most effective dietary supplements</b>.<br><br> <i>Prescription for Nutritional Healing: The A-to-Z Guide to Supplements</i> draws on America's number-one bestselling guide to natural health, <i>Prescription for Nutritional Healing</i>, to present authoritative information about some 350 of the most important dietary supplements available today, in a handy, redesigned format.

In the early '70s, he tossed off one of the funniest, most revealing, insider's takes on baseball life in <i>Ball Four,</i> his diary of the season he tried to pitch his way back from oblivion on the strength of a knuckler. The real curve, though, is Bouton's honesty. He carves humans out of heroes, and shines a light into the game's corners. A quarter century later, Bouton's unique baseball voice can still bring the heat.For the new edition of this historic book, Jim Bouton has written a highly entertaining epilogue, reflecting upon his life at the age of 60, the traumatic death of his daughter, and the heartwarming invitation from the Yankees to play in his first Old-Timers&#x2019; Day game since his exile from the club. Says the author about his ground-breaking book, "By establishing new boundaries, Ball Four changed sports reporting at least to the extent that, after the book, it was no longer possible to sell the milk and cookies image again. Besides, you can get sick on milk and cookies." Ball Four is a high-and-inside fastball that will forever be a journalistic classic.</p><h2>Dark Forces: New Stories of Suspense and Supernatural Horror</h2><p>A superb collection of twenty-two never-before-published horror stories by such masters as Bradbury, Oates, and Singer, is crowned by &#34;The Mist,&#34; a terrifying short novel by Stephen King</p><p><i>Dark Forces</i> is one of the greatest collections of original horror stories published since World War II, and it may prove to be one of the most influential anthologies of its kind, ever. Edited by award-winning editor (and recognized authority) Kirby McCauley, this was the first superstar collection of famous horror writers. It has been often imitated but never surpassed. McCauley was inspired by another landmark collection; his goal was to publish an anthology "with the same scope and dynamism of Harlan's Ellison's <i>Dangerous Visions</i>, but in the supernatural horror field." <i>Dark Forces</i> succeeds on every level, especially in the selection of the 24 contributors, a "Who's Who" from across the spectrum of imaginative literature: Richard Matheson, Dennis Etchison, Ramsey Campbell, Ray Bradbury, Robert Bloch, Joyce Carol Oates, Isaac Bashevis Singer. Oh, yes, also found here is the first appearance of an unforgettable short novel called "The Mist" by an up-and-comer named Stephen King. <i>Dark Forces</i> belongs on the shelf of anyone who desires the very best the field has to offer. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i></p><h2>Beading in the Native American Tradition</h2><p><p>Full-color photographs illustrate the rich art of Native American beadwork in this combination practical how-to and coffee-table book.

A rebel from start to finish (1694 - 1778), Voltaire was an ailing and unwanted bastard child who refused to die; and when he did consent to expire some eighty-four years later, he secured a Christian burial despite a bishop&#39;s ban. During much of his life Voltaire was the toast of society for his plays and verse, but his barbed wit and commitment to human reason got him into trouble. Jailed twice and eventually banished by the King, he was an outspoken critic of religious intolerance and persecution. His personal life was as colourful as his intellectual life. Of independent means and mind, Voltaire never married, but he had long-term affairs with two women: Emilie, who died after giving birth to the child of another lover, and his niece, Marie-Louise, with whom he spent the last twenty-five years of his life. The consummate outsider; a dissenter who craved acceptance while flamboyantly disdaining it; author of countless stories, poems, plays, treatises and tracts, as well as some twenty thousand letters to his friends; Voltaire&#39;s long, hyperactive life makes for engaging and entertaining reading.</p><p>Roger Pearson is Professor of French at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of Queen&#39;s College. He has translated and edited Candide and Other Stories for Oxford World&#39;s Classics and is the author of The Fables of Reason: A Study of Voltaire&#39;s Contes Philosophiques. His other publications include books on Stendhal and Mallarme.&#39;The book is an admirable achievement; it makes a compelling narrative out of the multiple character of Voltaire&#39;s gifts, the teeming output of his pen, and the complicated nature of eighteenth-century France ...

Twenty miles from the crash site, Deborah Sanborn has a vision of two survivors, cold, hurting and scared. Over the years she has learned to trust her gift, and she senses these strangers are in terrible danger. She sees a hunter, moving in for the kill.<br>Four generations of O'Ryan men have gathered at the crash site, ready to search for the missing boy, Johnny O'Ryan. His forty-five-year-old grandfather Mike O'Ryan isn't sure what to make of Deborah, but with the snow coming down, sh's all they've got to lead them through the mountains. Because not only are they racing against time and the elements...they're up against a killer desperate to silence his only living witnesses to murder.</p><p><p>"Senator, you need to hurry or you're going to miss your flight."</p> <p>Patrick Finn waved at his assistant to indicate he understood, then moved his cell phone from his right ear to his left.</p> <p>"Look, Wilson, I just can't do that and keep my con-stituents happy come next election. I'm in this for the long haul. If I vote for your bill, I'll be selling out over half the population of my state. We make our living in cotton and tobacco, you know. I can't in good con-science cast my vote to keep your people happy and destroy the tobacco industry at the same time. I know you understand." </p> <p>The knot in Senator Darren Wilson's gut pulled a little bit tighter. He stacked notepads in stacks of threes as he listened, unaware that his OCD had kicked in again. This couldn't be happening. If he didn't get this bill through Congress as he'd promised, his life wouldn't be worth a nickel. He was in this mess because of gambling. Passing this bill had been his way out of a quarter-million-dollar gambling note, and welshing on the people he owed was not an option. Neither was backing out of his word. </p> <p>He stared down at the handful of photos he'd received in the mail yesterday. One of his ex-wife, one of his daughter, who hadn't spoken to him in three years, and two of his grandchildren playing outside on the playground of their Dallas grade school. The pictures were numbered from one to four. He got the message. If he failed to come through for the people he owed, they were going to go after his family in the order in which the photos were numbered.</p> <p>And God help him, his ex-wife was number one. At this point in his life, she pretty much hated his guts, but he didn't have it in him to sacrifice her or any of them to get himself out of debt. Besides, he knew that wouldn't be the end of it. They would still do him in. He would just have the privilege of knowing that he'd wiped every single member of his family off the face of the earth before he died, too.</p> <p>He closed his eyes, cleared his throat, then gave Patrick Finn one more push.</p> <p>"Finn, you don't understand. I <i>need</i> your vote to keep my family alive."</p> <p>Finn frowned. He knew that Wilson gambled. Everyone on the Hill knew it. It came as no surprise that he was probably in trouble with a casino owner some-where, or even some loan shark, but none of that was Finn's fault or business. </p> <p>"I'm sorry, Darren, truly I am. But I can't sell out my state because you can't stay away from the poker tables."</p> <p>"No! Wait! You&#x2014;"</p> <p>"No, and that's my final answer," Finn said. "Now, I've got to go, or I'm going to miss my flight." </p> <p>When the phone line went dead, Darren Wilson felt as if he wasn't far behind. He stared at the framed photos of his daughters and grandchildren on his desk, then shifted through the ones he'd gotten in the mail. Every aspect of from the bottom drawer of his desk, then walked toward a large painting hanging on the opposite wall.</p> <p>He pulled it back, revealing the wall safe behind it. A few quick turns of the dial and the safe came open. Inside was his contingency plan: a fake passport and fifty thousand dollars in cash.</p> <p>He put the money in the bag and the passport in his pocket, closed the safe and checked it three times before putting the painting back in place. That it had come to this was at best depressing, but he had no option. Damn Patrick Finn all to hell. Leaving wasn't what Darren wanted to do, but if he wanted to stay alive, it was his only way out.</p> <p>He draped his overcoat over the small bag, grabbed his hat from a hook on the wall and headed out of the door, pausing at his secretary's desk long enough to issue one last order.</p> <p>"Connie, please cancel all my appointments for this afternoon. Something has come up."</p> <p>"Yes, sir. Do you want me to reschedule?"</p> <p>"Not today. I'll let you know later." "Yes, sir," the secretary said again, and picked up the phone to do what she'd been told as Darren Wilson walked out the door.</p> <p>A short while later, Patrick Finn was rushing through the D.C. airport, trying to catch his flight to Atlanta, where he lived. He had to swing by his home to pick up some clothes before heading out to Albuquerque, where he would rent a car and drive to Santa Fe, where he would spend Christmas. His wife and kids were already there with his parents, and he was looking forward to getting away for the holidays. He kept glancing at his watch as he ran, and knew it was going to be close. An accident on the freeway had left traffic at a standstill for more than thirty-five minutes. By the time the cab driver had pulled up at the airport, Finn was late. </p> <p>He sprinted past stores that smelled of hot coffee and cinnamon buns, as well as pubs serving beer and sand-wiches to passengers with time to spare. </p> <p>When he finally reached Gate 36, he was just in time to watch the plane pulling away from the ramp.</p> <p>"Wait!" he yelled. "That's my plane. I have to be on that plane!"</p> <p>"I'm sorry, sir, but you're too late," the attendant said.</p> <p>"I can't be too late! I'm Senator Patrick Finn."</p> <p>It was nothing the attendant hadn't heard before, and as the plane taxied toward the runway, she was already calmly booking Patrick Finn on the next plane to Atlanta. Considering it was the Christmas holidays, it was the best she could do for him.</p> <p>Finn knew it, too, but it didn't make him any happier as he waited the two and a half hours for the flight on which he'd now been rebooked.</p> <p>It was late evening when the plane landed in Atlanta, and by the time he got off, he'd already decided just to buy some clothes in Santa Fe rather than go home to pack, then try to make it back through evening traffic to catch his next flight. He called his wife, told her what was happening, then settled down to wait at the gate for boarding to begin. </p> <p>An hour later, the process began. "Welcome aboard, sir," the attendant said, as he stepped off the ramp and onto the plane.</p> <p>"Thank you," he said, nodding briefly as he scanned the aisles for his seat. </p> <p>That it was not in first class was something he was going to have to live with. Holiday travel was hectic at best, and considering it was his fault he'd missed his first flight, he wasn't about to get picky about this one. </p> <p>He thumped and bumped his one carry-on down the aisle until he got to his seat, smiling to himself as he realized it was on the aisle. He nodded to the pretty young woman in the seat behind him as he put his carry-on in the overhead compartment, then folded his coat and laid it on top of the bag.</p> <p>"Good evening, miss," he said cordially, as he closed the door to the compartment.</p> <p>"Good evening," she answered, then returned her at-tention to the magazine she was reading.</p> <p>Patrick winked at the little boy sitting across the aisle, then dug in his pocket for one of the silver dollars for which he was famous for giving out during his cam-paigns. He pretended to pull it out of the little boy's ear, then handed it to him as a treat.</p> <p>"Wow! Granddad, did you see that? He pulled that money out of my ear."</p> <p>"I sure did, Johnny boy. Better put that in your pocket before you lose it."</p> <p>The little boy was so thrilled, he reached into his other ear, checking to see if there might be one in there, as well, before dropping the oversize coin into the pocket of his pants.</p> <p>The older couple who were with the boy laughed along with the senator, and the moment passed.</p> <p>Finn sat down, straightening his clothes, and was reaching for his seat belt when he heard a familiar voice. He looked up, stunned by the coincidence and silently cursing the hands of fate that had done this to him.</p> <p>"Wow. What are the odds of this happening?" Darren Wilson said. "I'm in the seat next to you." He waved his boarding pass to prove his point.</p> <p>Patrick stood up without comment to let Darren be seated, then sat back down.</p> <p>"This was meant to be," Darren said.</p> <p>Patrick refused to be baited. "Going home for the holidays?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>In fact Darren Wilson was on his way out of the country, hopscotching on whatever flights were avail-able on such short notice, but he wasn't going to tell Patrick Finn that.</p> <p>"Have a good flight," Patrick said. "I don't mean to be rude, but I'm joining the family in Santa Fe, so I'm planning on catching up on my sleep on the way." </p> <p>Darren just smiled as he thought about what this could mean. Maybe this was one of those meant-to-be moments that would let him get out of trouble after all. He locked and unlocked his seat belt three times and then took a deep breath, before the urge to repeat finally ceased.</p> <p>Patrick could pretend to sleep all he wanted, because whether Finn liked it or not, he was going to be Darren's captive audience for the next three hours. He went from a feeling of hopelessness to an adrenaline high. God was with him after all.</p>Bestseller McCall's latest romantic thriller has all the elements that her fans have come to expect, though some readers may find she goes over the top with her high-velocity plot. A tragic plane crash in the Appalachian mountains brings together a disparate group of survivors&#x2014;Patrick Finn and Darren Wilson, two U.S. senators who happen to get adjoining seats on the doomed flight; Johnny O'Ryan, a young boy whose grandparents perish in the crash; and Molly Cifelli, a young child welfare worker. Wilson already holds a furious grudge against the other senator, who refused to vote for legislation that would have gotten the mob off Wilson's back. In the wreckage of the downed plane, the other two survivors witness Wilson murder Finn, leading to a desperate game of cat and mouse as the killer seeks to eliminate the loose ends. Local psychic Deborah Sanborn has visions of the crash and its aftermath that help several generations of O'Ryans in their rescue efforts, and in the process she falls for Johnny's father. Though it can feel contrived&#x2014;the coincidental seating of the political adversaries in particular&#x2014;those with a well-developed suspension of disbelief should enjoy the ride. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Rumors of wrongdoing had long circulated. But in 2017, when Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey began their investigation into the prominent Hollywood producer for the <i>New York Times</i>, his name was still synonymous with power. During months of confidential interviews with top actresses, former Weinstein employees, and other sources, many disturbing and long-buried allegations were unearthed, and a web of onerous secret payouts and nondisclosure agreements was revealed. These shadowy settlements had long been used to hide sexual harassment and abuse, but with a breakthrough reporting technique Kantor and Twohey helped to expose it. But Weinstein had evaded scrutiny in the past, and he was not going down without a fight; he employed a team of high-profile lawyers, private investigators, and other allies to thwart the investigation. When Kantor and Twohey were finally able to convince some sources to go on the record, a dramatic final showdown between Weinstein and the <i>New York Times</i> was set in motion.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nothing could have prepared Kantor and Twohey for what followed the publication of their initial Weinstein story on October 5, 2017. Within days, a veritable Pandora&#x2019;s box of sexual harassment and abuse was opened. Women all over the world came forward with their own traumatic stories. Over the next twelve months, hundreds of men from every walk of life and industry were outed following allegations of wrongdoing. But did too much change&#x2014;or not enough? Those questions hung in the air months later as Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford came forward to testify that he had assaulted her decades earlier. Kantor and Twohey, who had unique access to Ford and her team, bring to light the odyssey that led her to come forward, the overwhelming forces that came to bear on her, and what happened after she shared her allegation with the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the tradition of great investigative journalism, <i>She Said</i> tells a thrilling story about the power of truth, with shocking new information from hidden sources. Kantor and Twohey describe not only the consequences of their reporting for the #MeToo movement, but the inspiring and affecting journeys of the women who spoke up&#x2014;for the sake of other women, for future generations, and for themselves.</p><p>Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey are investigative reporters at the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>. Kantor has focused on the workplace in her reporting, and particularly the treatment of women, covered two presidential campaigns, and is the author of&nbsp;<i>The Obamas</i>. Twohey has focused much of her attention on the treatment of women and children, and, in 2014, as a reporter with Reuters News, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting. Kantor and Twohey shared numerous honors for breaking the Harvey Weinstein story, including a George Polk Award, and, along with colleagues, the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.</p><h2>Vengeance (Rogue Warrior)</h2><p>In the wake of a series of terrorist attacks that culminate in a chemical explosion, a train hijacking, and a high-profile murder, the Rogue Warrior uncovers a plot to attack the United States most relevant landmarks and institutions, a situation that results in a deadly international manhunt.

Visit Richard Marcinko's website at www.dickmarcinko.com.As usual, Marcinko's indestructible hero of his Rogue Warrior series is... himself. This time around (his 11th), Marcinko and his ex-military Rogue Warriors, operating as a private security company, are pulling off very successful attack exercises on transportation and energy targets in the U.S. While Marcinko and his pals are embarrassing the Department of Homeland Security (and offering hilariously deadpan, expletive-filled assessments of the government's performance), someone is sending Marcinko deadly messages, with more in mind than a public relations kerfuffle. As Marcinko investigates the puzzling clues, a cloudy picture emerges of Bosnian Muslim terrorists, smuggling, a missing French intelligence agent, strange connections to the Vietnam War and a very real threat of another major terrorist attack on U.S. soil. The story rushes from one pile of dead bodies to the next and ends with an exciting showdown at the Las Vegas Sands. While the action is tight (and spiked with cool super-spook technology), the villains' motives and malice are weak and unconvincing. Marcinko's highly profane first person remains as funny and charming as ever, though, and fans won't be disappointed. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the city-states that gave birth to Western civilization, drugs were an everyday&nbsp;element&nbsp;of a free society. Often they were not just available, but vitally necessary for use in medicine, religious ceremonies, and war campaigns. Their proponents and users existed in all classes, from the common soldier to the emperor himself.<br>Citing examples in myths, medicine, and literature, D. C. A. Hillman shows how drugs have influenced and inspired the artists, philosophers, and even politicians whose ideas have formed the basis for civilization as we know it. Many of these ancient texts may seem well-known, but Hillman shows how timid, prudish translations have left scholars and readers in the dark about the reality of drug use in the Classical world.&nbsp;<br>Hillman&#x2019;s argument is not simply &#x201c;pro-drug.&#x201d; Instead, he appeals for an intellectual honesty that acknowledges the use of drugs in ancient societies despite today&#x2019;s conflicting social mores.

He studied music at the Akademie Mozarteum in Salzburg. In 1957 he began a second career, as a playwright, poet, and novelist. The winner of the three most distinguished and coveted literary prizes awarded in Germany, he has become one of the most widely translated and admired writers of his generation. He published nine novels, an autobiography, one volume of poetry, four collections of short stories, and six volumes of plays. Thomas Bernhard died in Austria in 1989.From March to December, writes Rudolf, while I was having to take large quantities of prednisolone, a fact which I am bound to record here, against the third acute onset of my sarcoidosis, I assembled every possible book and article written by or about Mendelssohn Bartholdy and visited every possible and impossible library in order to acquaint myself thoroughly with my favourite composer and his work, preparing myself with the most passionate seriousness for the task, which I had been dreading throughout the preceding winter, of writing &#x2014; such was my pretension &#x2014; a major work of impeccable scholarship. It had been my intention to devote the most careful study to all these books and articles and only then, having studied them with all the thoroughness the subject deserved, to begin writing my work, which I believed would leave far behind it and far beneath it everything else, both published and unpublished, which I had previously written in the field of what is called musicology. I had been planning it for ten years and had repeatedly failed to bring it to fruition, but now I had resolved to begin writing on the twenty-seventh of January at precisely four o'clock in the morning, after the departure of my sister, who was due to leave on the twenty-sixth, and whose presence in Peiskam had for weeks put paid to any thought of my starting work on Mendelssohn Bartholdy. On the evening of the twenty-sixth my sister had finally gone, with all her dreadful faults, which are the result of her unhealthy craving to dominate and her distrust of everything, but especially of me, a distrust by which she was consumed to a higher degree than anyone else, but from which she daily drew fresh vitality. I went round the house, breathing deeply, and aired it thoroughly. Finally, since tomorrow was the twenty-seventh, I set about arranging everything I needed to carry out my plan, arranging the books and articles, the papers and the piles of notes on my desk in precise accordance with those rules which I had always observed as a precondition for starting work. We must be alone and free from all human contact if we wish to embark upon an intellectual task! These preparations occupied me for more than five hours, from half past eight in the evening until half past two in the morning, and, as was only to be expected, I didn't sleep for the rest of the night, being continually tormented above all by the thought that my sister might return for some reason and frustrate my plans. In her condition she was capable of anything: the smallest incident, the slightest upset, I told myself, would be enough to make her break her journey home and return here. It would not be the first time I had seen her to the Vienna train and parted from her, as I thought, for months, only to have her back in my house two or three hours later to stay for as long as she chose. I lay awake, constantly listening for her at the door, alternating between listening for my sister at the door and thinking about my work, and especially about <i>how</i> to begin it, how the first sentence should run, for I still didn't know <i>how</i> to word the first sentence, and before I know the wording of the first sentence I can't begin any work. So all the time I was tormented by listening for my sister's return and by thinking of how I should word my first sentence on Mendelssohn Bartholdy. Again and again I listened despairingly, and again and again I thought, just as despairingly, about the first sentence of my work on Mendelssohn. I spent about two hours thinking about the first sentence of my Mendelssohn study and at the same time listening for my sister's return, which would put an end to my study before it was even started. However, since I listened for her return with ever increasing intentness, reflecting that, if she did return, she would inevitably ruin my work, while at the same time thinking about the wording of my first sentence, I must finally have nodded off. When I awoke with a start it was five o'clock. I had meant to begin working at four o'clock and now it was five. I was alarmed by this negligence of mine, or rather this lack of discipline. I got up and wrapped myself in a blanket, the horse blanket I had inherited from my maternal grandfather, and tied it round me as tightly as I could with the leather belt which was also inherited from my grandfather, so tightly that I could scarcely breathe. Then I sat down at my desk. Of course it was completely dark. I made sure that I was alone in the house. I could hear nothing except my own pulse beat. I took the four prednisolone tablets, which had been prescribed by the specialist, with a glass of water and smoothed out the sheet of paper I had put in front of me. I'll calm down and begin work, I told myself. Again and again I said to myself, I'll calm down and begin work. But after I had said this about a hundred times and could no longer stop saying it I gave up. My attempt had failed. It was impossible for me to begin work in the early morning light. The dawn had completely dashed my hopes. I got up and fled from my desk. I went downstairs into the hall, believing that I should be able to calm myself there, where it was cold, for by sitting for more than one whole hour at my desk I had worked myself into a state of agitation which made me almost demented, brought on not only by mental concentration, but also, as I had feared, by the prednisolone tablets. I pressed both palms against the cold wall of the hall, a well-tried method for overcoming this kind of agitation, and I actually did calm down. I was conscious of having surrendered myself to a subject which might possibly destroy me, but all the same I had believed that I could at least make a start on my work this morning. I had deluded myself. Although she had gone, I still felt the presence of my sister in every part of the house. It would be impossible to imagine a person more hostile to anything intellectual than my sister. The very thought of her robs me of my capacity for any intellectual activity, and she has always stifled at birth any intellectual projects I have had. She's been gone a long time now, and yet she is still controlling me, I thought as I pressed my hands against the cold wall of the hall. At last I had enough strength to remove them and take a few steps. I also failed in my plan to write something on <i>Jenufa</i>. That was in October, not long before my sister came to stay, I told myself. And now I'm failing with Mendelssohn Bartholdy, I'm failing even when my sister is no longer here. I didn't even finish the sketch On Sch�nberg. She annihilated it for me: first she destroyed it, then she finally annihilated it, by coming into the room at the very moment when I thought I was going to be able to complete it. There's no defence against a person like my sister, who is at once so strong and so anti-intellectual; she comes and annihilates whatever has taken shape in one's mind as a result of exerting, indeed of over-exerting one's memory for months on end, whatever it is, even the most trifling sketch on the most trifling subject. And there's nothing so fragile as music, to which I have actually given myself up completely in recent years. At first I gave myself up to listening to music, then to studying the theory of music; first I devoted myself with the utmost intensity to the practical study of music, then to the theoretical, but my plans were all frustrated by my sister and everybody like her, whose lack of understanding dogs me day and night. She destroyed <i>Jenufa</i> for me, and <i>Moses and Aaron</i>, my essay <i>On Rubinstein</i>, and my article on <i>Les Six</i>, in fact everything I held sacred. It's terrible: no sooner am I capable of a piece of intellectual work than my sister turns up and destroys it. It's as if her sole aim in life were to destroy my intellectual work. It's as if, living in Vienna, she could sense that I am about to embark on a subject here in Peiskam; and when I do, she turns up and destroys it. People exist for the sole purpose of tracking down the intellect and annihilating it. Sensing that somebody's brain is on the point of some intellectual effort, they come along and stifle this intellectual effort at birth. And if it isn't my wretched, malignant, deceitful sister, then it's somebody else of her kind. How many essays have I begun, only to burn them because my sister has turned up, only to throw them in the stove the moment she's appeared! No one is so fond of saying, <i>I'm not disturbing you, am I?</i> That's rich coming from someone who's always disturbed people and always will, whose sole mission in life seems to be to disturb, to disturb anything and everything and so destroy it and finally annihilate it, constantly to annihilate what to me is the most important thing in the world &#x2014; a product of the mind. Even when we were children she would try at every opportunity to disturb me, to drive me out of my mental paradise, as I called it. If I had a book in my hands she would pursue me until I put it down. If, in fury, I threw it in her face, she was triumphant. I remember it all so well: if I had my maps spread out on the floor &#x2014; which is a lifelong passion of mine &#x2014; she would emerge from hiding behind my back and startle me, putting her foot on the very spot where all my attention was concentrated. I can still see her foot placed suddenly and viciously wherever I had spread out my beloved countries and continents in order to fill them full with my childish imaginings. At the age of five or six I used to withdraw into the garden with a book. On one occasion, which I can remember clearly, it was a blue-bound volume of the poems of Novalis from my grandfather's library. In this book, which of course I didn't properly understand, I discovered such delights as were sufficient to fill my Sunday afternoon for hour after hour, until my sister discovered where I was and, darting out from the bushes with a yell, snatched the volume of Novalis from me. Our younger sister was entirely different, but she's been dead for thirty years, and it's senseless to compare her now with my elder sister, to compare one who was always ailing and ill and finally died with one who is always healthy and dominates all around her. Even her husband put up with her for only two and a half years, after which he fled from her stranglehold and went to South America, to Peru, never to be heard of again. She's always destroyed whatever she's touched, and all her life she's tried to destroy me. At first unconsciously, then consciously, she's set out to annihilate me. Right up to this day I've had to protect myself against my elder sister's savage desire to annihilate, and I really don't know how so far I've managed to escape her. She turns up when she feels like it, she leaves when she feels like it, and she does what she feels like doing. She married her husband, who was a real estate broker, <i>in order</i> to drive him to Peru and get complete control of his real estate business. She's a business woman. Even as a very small child she was that way inclined, towards the persecution of the intellect and the closely concomitant pursuit of money. That we should have had the same mother is something I've never been able to understand. She'd now been out of the house for almost twenty-four hours, yet she was still in control of me. I couldn't escape her. I tried desperately but didn't succeed. I'm horrified by the thought that to this day, when she travels by sleeper, she makes a principle of sleeping only in her own sheets. For the third time I flung open the windows and aired the whole house, until the cold air had turned it into an ice-box in which I was in danger of freezing to death. At first I'd been afraid of suffocating; now I was afraid of freezing to death. And all this because of my sister, under whose influence I've been in danger of either suffocating or freezing to death all my life. In her apartment in Vienna she actually stays in bed until half-past-ten and doesn't go for lunch at the Imperial or the Sacher until about half-past-one. There, as she dissects her boiled fillet of beef and sips her vin rose, she does business with her effete princes and with imperial highnesses of every possible and impossible kind. I'm nauseated by the kind of life she leads. On the day of her departure she didn't do a thing to tidy up her room before she left, so that the very sight of it made me feel embarrassed at the thought of what Frau Kienesberger would think, though she was not due to come till the following weekend. She's been keeping the house in order for over ten years. Everything was piled up in three great heaps, and the duvet was lying on the floor. And although I'd opened all the windows, as I've already said, my sister's smell was still in the room. In fact it permeated the house and made me feel sick. She has my younger sister on her conscience, I often think, for she too went in constant fear of her elder sister, towards the end probably in deadly fear. Parents have a child, and in doing so they bring into the world a monster that kills everything it comes into contact with, it seems to me. At one time I'd written an essay on Haydn &#x2014; Michael, not Josef &#x2014; when she suddenly appeared and knocked the pen out of my hand. Since I hadn't finished the essay, it was ruined. <i>Now I've ruined your essay!</i> she cried out ecstatically, whereupon she ran to the window and shouted out this diabolical statement several times. <i>Now I've ruined your essay! Now I've ruined your essay!</i> I was no match for such hideous surprise attacks. At table she destroyed every conversation as it was just beginning, merely by laughing suddenly or interjecting some impossibly stupid remark which had no bearing on the incipient conversation.</p><h2>Return of the Plumed Serpent: War God Trilogy: Book Two</h2><p>Return of the Plumed Serpent</p><p>As East Africa correspondent of The Economist in the early eighties Graham Hancock began to write a series of highly acclaimed books on economics, politics and foreign aid. His life took a whole new turn when he became fascinated by rumours that the Ark of the Covenant is real artefact, hidden somewhere in northern Africa. The story of his detective work, tracking it down to its supposed final resting place became the international bestseller The Sign and the Seal (now in production as a feature film.) More bestsellers in the field of &#39;alternative history&#39; followed, including Fingerprints of the Gods, Keeper of Genesis (the latter co-authored with Robert Bauval) and Heaven&#39;s Mirror. In Supernatural he described his experiences journeying to experiment with hallucinogenic drugs amongst tribes people for whom they represent a gateway into supernatural realms. His ideas on exploring new dimensions in consciousness became the subject of his controversial TED talks. Graham Hancock&#39;s books have been translated into twenty-seven languages and have sold over nine million copies worldwide. His public lectures and broadcasts, including two major TV series for Channel 4, Quest for the Lost Civilisation, and Flooded Kingdoms of the Ice Age, have further established his reputation as an unconventional thinker who raises controversial questions about humanity`s past.Interweaving historical fact and vivid fiction, Graham Hancock&#39;s War God is packed full of blood, guts, conflict, sacrifice and witchcraft in the last days of the Aztec empire. The story of the Spanish conquest of Mexico and the downfall of Moctezuma is the perfect (if very gory) distraction from modern life. * Wanderlust * Five hundred years ago the old Mexican prophecy which announced the return of Quetzalcoatl came true. In an era dominated by human sacrifices and the decadence of a great culture, bearded men, white-faced, from beyond the sea, arrived to impose their law. In this fast-moving highly recommended novel, Graham Hancock masterfully reconstructs the biggest clash of civilizations ever, revealing aspects that only a genius author could unveil. * Javier Sierra New York Times bestselling author of The Secret Supper and The Lost Angel * The book offers up a heady mix of action, politics, spirituality and the supernatural and we learn a lot...Convincing fantasy elements and viscerally recreated details keep the narrative charging forward. * Daily Mail * ...part historical fact, part fantasy, the effect is as intense as the events themselves.

He is the author of twelve collections of Rumpole stories and three acclaimed volumes of autobiography.The second Rumpole collection, published in 1979, gives listeners a chance to catch up on the doings at 3 Equity Court. The Erskine-Browns are just beginning their troubled marriage, and Guthrie Featherstone seeks the judgeship that will give Horace Rumpole grief in later installments. The last story, "Rumpole and the Age of Retirement," sounds deceptively like a finale to Rumpole's career, but it's no secret that his saga continues. Bill Wallis works too hard to sound like Leo McKern, the late actor identified with Rumpole, but his portrayal gains strength with familiarity. His handling of dialogue, particularly Rumpole's parrying with a client in "Rumpole and the Showfolk," is deft.

And though treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder has undoubtedly alleviated suffering and allowed many service members returning from combat to transition to civilian life, the suicide rate for veterans under thirty has been increasing. Research by Veterans Administration health professionals and veterans&#x2019; own experiences now suggest an ancient but unaddressed wound of war may be a factor: moral injury. This deep-seated sense of transgression includes feelings of shame, grief, meaninglessness, and remorse from having violated core moral beliefs.<br>&nbsp;<br>Rita Nakashima Brock and Gabriella Lettini, who both grew up in families deeply affected by war, have been working closely with vets on what moral injury looks like, how vets cope with it, and what can be done to heal the damage inflicted on soldiers&#x2019; consciences. In <i>Soul Repair</i>, the authors tell the stories of four veterans of wars from Vietnam to our current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan&#x2014;Camillo &#x201c;Mac&#x201d; Bica, Herman Keizer Jr., Pamela Lightsey, and Camilo Mej�a&#x2014;who reveal their experiences of moral injury from war and how they have learned to live with it. Brock and Lettini also explore its effect on families and communities, and the community processes that have gradually helped soldiers with their moral injuries.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Soul Repair</i> will help veterans, their families, members of their communities, and clergy understand the impact of war on the consciences of healthy people, support the recovery of moral conscience in society, and restore veterans to civilian life. When a society sends people off to war, it must accept responsibility for returning them home to peace.<br>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Rita Nakashima Brock</b> is research professor and codirector of the Soul Repair Center at Brite Divinity School, Ft.

German Keizer Jr.,<br>Colonel and Chaplain, U.S. Army, Ret.<br><br>After we send men and women off to war, how do we bring them home to peace?<br>Obviously &nbsp;distraught, the three people huddled, whispering&nbsp; to each other while they waited patiently at the end of a long line that had formed after Rita&#x2019;s lecture on moral injury in Houston, Texas. When the two women and the man finally reached her, they said they were from a United Methodist Church. Their words tumbled out on top of each other: &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know how much your lecture meant to us . . . We didn&#x2019;t know how to help him . . . The suicide was such a shock . . . The whole church is heartbroken . . . We wish we had known about moral injury . . . It makes so much sense . . . Maybe we could have helped him.&#x201d;<br><br>The group&#x2019;s distress was raw and urgent. Their description was dis- jointed, as if their jumbled memories had not come into focus. When they realized that Rita was puzzled, they filled in some of the details. They explained that the suicide of a young veteran, deeply beloved in their church, was unexpected. The whole church community was reeling&nbsp; and struggling to understand how it had failed him. He was a hero to so many, they said, that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) had sent crisis counselors to a national gathering of veterans meeting at the time of the suicide. After the group explained the impact of the suicide on them and their community, one of the women said, &#x201c;We want to learn more about moral injury. Our community needs this information. We couldn&#x2019;t save Clay, but maybe we can help save others.&#x201d; Within days of Rita&#x2019;s lecture in April 2011, national media sources reported Clay Warren Hunt&#x2019;s story. He was a twenty-eight-year-old former marine corporal who earned a Purple Heart serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. He had been active in a suicide-prevention program for vets. Since 2009, he had been a model to other veterans of a successful return home. He married and started college in California; he advo- cated for veterans&#x2019; rights and worked in disaster relief. He was being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Then, his marriage ended, he left school, went into treatment for depression, and returned to Houston where he got a job and an apartment in Sugar Land, Texas. On March 31, 2011, he bolted himself in that apartment and shot<br>himself. Over a thousand people attended his funeral.<br><br>Veteran suicides average &nbsp;one every&nbsp; eighty minutes, an unprecedented eighteen a day or six thousand a year. They are 20 percent of all U.S. suicides, though veterans of all wars are only about 7 percent of the U.S. population. Between 2005 and 2007, the national suicide rate among veterans under age thirty <i>rose 26 percent. </i>In Texas&#x2014;home of the largest military base in the world and the third-highest veteran population&#x2014;<i>rates rose 40 percent </i>between 2006 and 2009. These rates continue, despite required mental health screenings of those leaving the military, more research on PTSD, and better methods for treating it. Veterans are also disproportionately homeless, unemployed, poor, divorced, and imprisoned. The statistics, however, do not disclose the devastating impact of war on veterans&#x2019; families and friends, on their communities, and on other veterans.<br><br>The journey home to peace is perilous after war. We can make it less lonely and lethal. The veterans&#x2019; stories that unfold in this book describe a wound of war called &#x201c;moral injury,&#x201d; the violation of core moral beliefs. The stories reveal the lifelong struggle of veterans&nbsp; to live with its scars, the impact on their families, and the various ways our society can support the recovery of those who experience moral injury.<br><br>Moral injury is not PTSD. Many books on veteran healing confuse and conflate them into one thing. It is possible, though, to have moral injury without PTSD. The difference between them is partly physi- cal. PTSD occurs in response to prolonged, extreme trauma and is a fear-victim reaction to danger. It produces hormones that affect the brain&#x2019;s amygdala and hippocampus, which control responses to fear, as well as regulate emotions and connect fear to memory. A sufferer often has difficulty forming a coherent memory of a traumatic event or may even be unable to recall it. Symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance, &nbsp;and dissociation.<br>Our ability to calm or extinguish fear and process emotions is often impaired by trauma, and a previous history of emotional trauma or a brain injury can make a person more susceptible to PTSD. Dissociative episodes can put sufferers back into experiences of terror and make them lose a sense of the present. They can feel unreasonable fear in ordinary situations or startle at sounds that mimic battle. They may experience a compulsive need to retell stories of terror, to reenact them, and to transfer past fear-inducing conditions to the present. With PTSD,&nbsp; memory erupts uncontrollably &nbsp;and retraumatizes the sufferer, which can make retrieving a coherent memory nearly impos- sible. Clinicians have treatments for PTSD, and such therapies are crucial for those diagnosed with it.<br><br>The moral questions emerge after the traumatizing symptoms of PTSD are relieved enough for a person to construct a coherent mem- ory of his or her experience. We organize emotionally intense memo- ries into a story in the brain&#x2019;s prefrontal cortex, where self-control, planning, reasoning, and decision making occur. The mind creates a pattern from memory fragments stored in various places. Emotions are essential to moral conscience, but until people can construct enough of a coherent narrative &nbsp;to grasp what they did, they cannot evalu- ate it. The brain organizes experiences and evaluates them, based on people&#x2019;s capacity to think about moral values and feel empathy at the same time.<br><br>Marine veteran&nbsp; and philosopher Camillo &#x201c;Mac&#x201d; Bica used the term <i>moral injury </i>in his war journals from Vietnam, and, from the per- spective both of warrior and of moral philosopher, he has explored the agony of this inner judgment against himself. Moral injury is the result of reflection on memories of war or other extreme traumatic condi- tions. It comes from having transgressed one&#x2019;s basic moral identity and violated core moral beliefs.<br><br>Moral injury names a deep and old dilemma of war. The moral an- guish of warriors defines much literature about war from ancient times to the present, such as the Greek <i>Iliad </i>and Indian <i>Bhagavad-Gita</i>, both war epics; the Hebrew Psalms; and modern novels and films, &nbsp;such as <i>Catch-22</i>, <i>The Deer Hunter</i>, or <i>Matterhorn. </i>We see discussions of moral injury in current memoirs of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In <i>Packing Inferno: The Unmaking of a Marine</i>, Tyler E. Boudreau, a veteran &nbsp;of Iraq and former Marine officer, reflects on the apparent inability of societies to learn from works of art and history about the torture that war inflicts on the souls of veterans. He concludes that societies have understood war only as much as they really wanted to learn about it and its deeper meaning.<br><br>Not everyone&nbsp; was so unable or unwilling to understand, Tyler notes. In <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, Virginia Woolf portrayed the suicidal anguish after World War I of Septimus Smith as if she were a veteran herself. Tyler reflects on her perceptive depiction:<br>&nbsp;<br>She was just a writer. That tells me, if nothing else, that the in- formation was there.&nbsp;The &nbsp;capacity &nbsp;to know existed. &nbsp;It wasn&#x2019;t beyond&nbsp; human understanding. They&nbsp; weren&#x2019;t &nbsp;too primitive. &nbsp;If Virginia Woolf knew about combat stress, everybody else could have known, too. They did not know because they didn&#x2019;t want to know.<br><br>Still, not even Tyler could face telling the truth about war. After he left the Corps, he worked as a Casualty Assistance &nbsp;Calls Officer (CACO), which required him to call the parents of wounded Marines. He could not bring himself to call soldiers&#x2019; families and report hon- estly that, among the wounds they suffered, &#x201c;your boy is coming home with a broken heart.&#x201d; Never once was he able to say it, and he regrets it still that he did not.<br><br>Moral injury results when soldiers violate their core moral beliefs, and in evaluating their behavior negatively, &nbsp;they feel they no longer live in a reliable, meaningful world and can no longer be regarded as decent human beings. They may feel this even if what they did was warranted and unavoidable. Killing, torturing prisoners, abusing dead bodies, or failing to prevent such acts can elicit moral injury. Handling human remains can be especially difficult; for example, in 2004, Jess Goodell served in the Marine Corps&#x2019; first Mortuary Affairs unit in Iraq, which required her to recover and process remains of fallen sol- diers, including drawing their outlines where they had fallen, filling in missing parts in black. In her memoir, <i>Shade It Black: Death and After&nbsp;in&nbsp;Iraq</i>,&nbsp;she describes the devastating aftermath of this work of facing death every day. Seeing someone else violate core moral values or feeling betrayed by persons in authority can also lead to a loss of meaning and faith. It can even emerge from witnessing a friend get killed and feeling survivor guilt. In experiencing a moral conflict, sol- diers may judge themselves as worthless; they may decide no one can be trusted and isolate themselves from others; and they may abandon the values and beliefs that gave their lives meaning and guided their moral choices. Recently, &nbsp;Veterans Affairs clinicians&nbsp; have begun to conceptualize moral injury as separate from PTSD and as a hidden wound of war.<br></p><h2>News from Somewhere: On Settling</h2><p>For a number of years Roger Scruton has contributed a weekly article to the Financial Times on country matters. Always beautifully written, one of these pieces (Vegetables) won the 2002 prize from The Queen&#39;s English Society for the best piece of prose writing of the year. These are not sentimental bucolic rambles. Scruton&#39;s prose is devoid of sentimentality and soggy nostalgia. Whatever he writes about, he always writes with serious purpose. He speaks up for the country dweller who sees his or her world eroded by the wishy-washy liberal commands of Blairite do-gooders who sit on their backsides in North West London pontificating about the needs of country people. Nature being red in tooth and claw is something that these people only know about from sitting in a classroom. Farming issues are equally important in this book. The devastations of the foot and mouth crisis showed graphically how great is the divide between town and country dwellers. And when the fate of people in the countryside is decided by bureaucrats in Brussels and Strasbourg, their feeling of alienation is even greater. These are the causes that Professor Scruton espouses and he has become their most intelligent, articulate and clear-thinking advocate.</p><p>Sir Roger Scruton is a writer and philosopher who has published more than forty books in philosophy, aesthetics and politics. He is widely translated. He is a fellow of the British Academy and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He teaches in both England and America and is a Senior Fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Washington D.C. He is currently teaching an MA in Philosophy for the University of Buckingham.' he exudes . . . a longing for belonging, a love of ponds more than rivers, a belief that the diminished colours in the winter landscape are what bind us to it . . .

The reader will find Scruton's memoir both charming and interesting. It is a layered and nuanced apologetic, brilliantly rendered, for a class of people who hover on the verge of extinction. And, while he writes of the intimate relationship among the farmer, his land, and stock his theme concerns the philosophical question of how we should live."- Robert C.

Many of the greatest traditions, ideas and discoveries of the West are traced to the teachings and writings of Sufi masters working centuries ago. </p><p>But "The Sufis" is far more than an historical account. </p><p>In the tradition of the great Sufi classics, the deeper appeal of this remarkable book is in its ability to function as an active instrument of instruction, in a way that is so clearly relevant to our time and culture. </p><p>The spiritual and psychological tradition of Sufism was regarded, before this pioneering book was published, as the preserve of ecstatic religionists and a small number of Oriental scholars, who treated it in the main as a minority cult. The false image of Sufism as a mere Islamic sect was changed so much by this book that it is now given serious attention as a psychological and mystical system of extraordinary richness and importance. </p><p>Today, studies in Sufism, notably through Shah's research and publication, are pursued in centers of higher learning throughout the world, in the fields of psychology, sociology, anthropology, and many other areas of current human concern. </p><p>"The Sufis" is the pivotal work which heralded the revelation of the astonishing richness and variety of Sufi thought and its contribution to human culture contained in Idries Shah's many books on the subject.</p></p><p>A unique and little-known religion, Sufism follows a mystical teaching and a way of life that has had an enormous though largely unrecognized impact on both the East and West for four thousand years. This authoritative book fills a colossal gap in Western documentation of Eastern subjects.As the urgency of our global situation becomes apparent, more and more readers are turning to the books of writer Idries Shah as a way to train new capacities and new ways of thinking. Shah has been described as "the most significant worker adapting classical spiritual thought to the modern world." His lively contemporary books have sold more than 15 million copies in 12 languages worldwide. They have been reviewed positively by The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Times (London), The Tribune, The Telegraph, and numerous other international journals and newspapers.

Stockbrokers, scientists, lawyers, managers, writers, physicians, and diplomats have found Shah's literature for human development "extraordinary." "It presents a blueprint of the human mental structure."</p><p>Robert Ornstein, psychologist and author "Extremely useful in teaching students about management and computers."</p><p>Thomas Malone, MIT "Idries Shah provides the unique perspective that allows us to assess real motivations and social biases in a more accurate light."</p><p>E.

The first volume focused on the story of God&#39;s dealings with Israel, or Israel&#39;s gospel. The second volume investigated the beliefs of Israel, or Israel&#39;s faith. Now the spotlight falls on the Old Testament&#39;s perspective on the life that Israel should live in its present and future, including its worship, prayer and spirituality, as well as its practices, attitudes and ethics before God. Goldingay sees three spheres of life giving order to Israel&#39;s vision: its life in relation to God, its life in community and the life of the individual as a self. Within these frameworks he unfurls a tapestry that is as broad and colorful as all of life, and yet detailed in its intricate attention to the text. With this final volume John Goldingay has given us the third pillar of an Old Testament theology that is monumental in scope and yet invites us to enter through multiple doors to explore its riches. Students will profit from a semester in its courts, and ministers of the Word will find their preaching and teaching deeply enriched by wandering its halls and meditating in its chambers.</p><p>John Goldingay (PhD, University of Nottingham; DD, Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth) is David Allan Hubbard Professor of Old Testament at Fuller Theological Seminary. He was previously principal and a professor of Old Testament and Hebrew at St John&#x2019;s Theological College in Nottingham, England. His books include <em>An Introduction to the Old Testament</em>, <em>The Theology of the Book of Isaiah</em>, <em>Key Questions about Interpretation</em>, <em>Do We Need the New Testament?</em> and commentaries on Psalms, Isaiah, and Daniel. He has also authored the three-volume <em>Old Testament Theology</em> and the seventeen-volume Old Testament For Everyone series. Goldingay also serves in pastoral ministry as an associate pastor at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church, Pasadena. He holds membership in the Society of Biblical Literature and the Society for Old Testament Study, and serves on the Task Force on Biblical Interpretation in the Anglican Communion and the editorial board for the Library of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament Studies."Going through this volume was like sitting in on lectures from a well-informed, wise, and witty lover of the OT. . . . I enjoyed the book, learned from it, and recommend it." (James Limburg, Interpretation, October 2011)<br><br>"Every evangelical interested in biblical ethics will find practical insights within its pages&#x2015;as well as a challenge to respond to some tough questions." (William D. Barrick, The Master's Seminary Journal, Fall 2011)<br><br>"A fresh and rich type of biblical theology for all." (James Chukwuman Okoye, The Bible in Review)<br><br>"With his characteristic thoroughness and engaging writing style, Goldingay offers a rich reflection on the life God expects of his people. This third volume of his tripartite theology begins with God himself as the appropriate place to ground the meaning and significance of this life. It then turns to explain the centrality of the communities within which individuals share their existence, grow in virtue and find their true self. Faith in action, worship and spirituality as inseparable from ethics, and leadership as service--these are a few of the emphases of the message of the Old Testament developed in this work. Read <em>Israel's Life</em> and deepen your appreciation of the Old Testament's relevance . . . and enhance your vision of a life well-lived and pleasing to God." (M. Daniel Carroll R., Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Finally, Goldingay's OT ethics! In a highly readable fashion he demonstrates masterfully that Israel's vision of life before God is not irrelevant to modern existence. In fact, the communal shape of Israel's faith, as well as its profound sense of individual responsibility and freedom, cast our own society's peculiar sicknesses into sharpest relief and point firmly in the direction of a cure. This is first-rate, thrilling stuff--the appropriate culmination of a glittering trilogy." (Stephen B. Chapman, Duke University)<br><br>"John Goldingay writes with magisterial knowledge of the biblical texts and a keen eye for how to open them in fresh ways for scholars, teachers, preachers and all serious readers. Drawing deeply and widely on the scholarly literature--and also on literature that most scholars would not think to consult--he demonstrates with utter lucidity and conviction how the Hebrew Scriptures present a vision of life in community that is still sane, salvific and maybe even more essential for this generation of faith than for our ancestors." (Dr. Ellen Davis, Amos Ragan Kearns Professor of Bible and Practical Theology, Duke Divinity School)<br><br>"In the third and final volume of his massive Old Testament Theology John Goldingay turns to ethics and explores 'the life of the children of God' (Barth). He shows how this is presented as response to the gospel as Israel experienced it and as an expression of their faith in Yhwh. Goldingay sees the ethics of the Old Testament as a direct call to us today: the presentation is as far from antiquarian as it could be. Christians and Jews alike will need to ponder this challenging work." (John Barton, Oriel &amp; Laing Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture, University of Oxford)<br><br>"The fruits of Goldingay's lifelong devotion to the study of the Old Testament are visible on every page. This work is a sure and steady guide that will lead the reader into the riches of Israel's legacy and its God." (Gary Anderson, professor of Old Testament/Hebrew Bible, University of Notre Dame)<br><br>"I highly recommend this third volume, along with the other two, as a rich contribution to the study of Old Testament theology and a rich exposition of God's truths as relevant for the lives of His people."

Peter Young explores how the oak, native to the northern hemisphere and found in locations as diverse as the Americas and tropical Asia, has played an important role in state-building, art, folk tales, poems, and songs.&nbsp;Starting with the pagan societies that venerated the oak, Young examines how the tree was used in other religions, revealing how it was believed to be a gateway between worlds in Celtic mythology and later became sacred to Thor in Norse mythology. He follows the oak as it was adopted by many Western European countries as a national symbol, including England, France, and Germany. The United States Congress designated the oak as America&#x2019;s national tree in 2004, and it is the state tree of Iowa, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, and Georgia. Individual oak trees have also gained historical importance, such as the Charter Oak in Hartford, Connecticut, which became a symbol of American independence. In addition to tracing the history of the tree itself, Young investigates oak as a wood used to make furniture, bridges, wine casks, homes, ships, weapons, and even the electric chair, and he describes how the tree has been used as a food source&#x2014;its fruit, the acorn, was eaten in ancient Greece, ancient Iberia, and Korea, and it was a traditional food of Native Americans.&nbsp;Packed with information and beautiful illustrations, <i>Oak</i> tells the fascinating tale of this stately, durable member of the natural world.</p><p><b>Peter Young</b> is an independent scholar who lives in Crawley, West Sussex, UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Handsomely designed and beautifully written volumes on subjects you might not think you&#x2019;re interested in. . . .

Part of an attractive, lavishly illustrated new series, perfect for house gifts if you&#x2019;re visiting someone who&#x2019;ll welcome you with clean towels and a trowel.&#x201d; (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Every page is crammed with well-researched facts and vignettes, not a boring one among them. It is not Peter Young&#x2019;s purpose to range across the huge and varied oak family; rather, he describes the oak in the context of the natural world and how it has served and influenced man from the Stone Age up to the present day. . . . His story of oak &#x2018;both the tree and the versatile timber&#x2019; is uplifting: a pity, I thought, to end with the gloomy and familiar refrain about climate change. But that is a small quibble; I still want to own this book, not just as a work of reference but also for the enjoyment it gives.&#x201d; (<i>House and Garden</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Young&#x2019;s carte blanche sends him off in all kinds of colourful and diverting by-ways. . . .

Dipping in is addictive.&#x201d; (<i>Living Woods Magazine</i>)</p><h2>Screwtape Letters</h2><p>The Screwtape Letters is a Christian apologetic novel by C. S. Lewis. It is written in a satirical, epistolary style and while it is fictional in format, the plot and characters are used to address Christian theological issues, primarily those to do with temptation and resistance to it. First published in February 1942, the story takes the form of a series of letters from a senior Demon Screwtape to his nephew Wormwood, a Junior Tempter. The uncle&#39;s mentorship pertains to the nephew&#39;s responsibility for securing the damnation of a British man known only as &#34;the Patient&#34;.</p><p>This adaptation of C.S. Lewis's biting satire received a 1999 Grammy nomination for best spoken-word performance, and it's easy to see why--the story fits the format perfectly. It's relatively brief (the unabridged reading takes a mere four hours), and contains only one character--the demon Screwtape, who writes letters to his novice nephew Wormwood, instructing him on how to best tempt his "patient" (a wayward soul on earth) into the bosom of "our Lord below." <p> Obviously, the book wasn't written with former Monty Python John Cleese in mind, but it's hard to imagine a better Screwtape. Cleese's voice provides the perfect vehicle for Lewis's dry, razor-edged wit. His uncanny comic timing and ability to milk each phrase for maximum effect betray an infectious enthusiasm for the story. It's clear that he's having a great time reading, and it's impossible not to laugh along with him. This inspired pairing of two of the 20th century's greatest wits makes for a meditation on the dark side of spiritual guidance that's as relevant and funny today as it was in Lewis's war-torn England. (Running time: 4 hours, 3 cassettes) --<i>Andrew Neiland</i></p>His letters are signed, save one, "Your affectionate uncle", yet Uncle Screwtape's purposes in writing to his young nephew are hardly innocent. Penned in a brisk, businesslike style, old Screwtape offers the gullible Tempter Wormword fiendishly clever advice on his most pressing concern: the winning of young lives to the devil.<p>First published in 1941, The Screwtape Letters, a perennial best seller, has earned a place in the library of classics. The truths contained in C. S. Lewis's treatise on human nature are as old as the world, but his witty observations continue to confront and challenge believers and nonbelievers alike.</p><p>The outcome of Screwtape's correspondence is not known. But judging from his final signoff -- "Your increasingly and ravenously affectionate uncle" -- his appetite for evil has not lessened.</p></p><h2>My Christmas Book</h2><p>I can enjoy this all year long for its timeless truths. It contains one of the most important thoughts that I have ever read. &#x201c;If I had my ministry over again, I would talk more about God.... His very self ...&#x201d; Once again it is obvious that Boreham wasn&#x2019;t just a preacher who writes. He became highly skilled in both occupations. It shows in how broadly but deeply he covers the theme of Christmas. He does so with characteristic wit and humor. He is a master at seeing glory in the commonplace, a little like what we behold in the Incarnation&#x2014;God in flesh appearing. --Michael Dalton</p><p></p><h2>The Sheltering Sky (Flamingo Modern Classics) (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p>The Sheltering Sky</p><p>American novelist and short-story writer, poet, translator, classical music composer, and filmscorer Paul Bowles has lived as an expatriate for more than 40 years in the North African nation of Morocco, a country that reaches into the vast and inhospitable Sahara Desert. The desert is itself a character in <b>The Sheltering Sky</b>, the most famous of Bowles' books, which is about three young Americans of the postwar generation who go on a walkabout into Northern Africa's own arid heart of darkness. In the process, the veneer of their lives is peeled back under the author's psychological inquiry.<p>When <em>The Sheltering Sky</em> was first published in 1949, it established Paul Bowles as one of the most singular and promising writers of the postwar generation. Its startlingly original vision has withstood the test of time and confirmed Tennessee Williams's early estimation: "<em>The Sheltering Sky</em> alone of the books that I have . . . read by American authors appears to bear the spiritual imprint of recent history in the western world." In this classic work of psychological terror, Bowles examines the ways in which Americans apprehend an alien culture and the ways in which their incomprehension destroys them.</p><p>The story of three worldly young travelers Port Moresby, his wife, Kit, and their friend, Tunner--adrift in the cities and deserts of North Africa after World War II, <em>The Sheltering Sky</em> is merciless in its evocation of the emotional dislocation induced by a foreign setting. As the Americans embark on an ill-fated journey through desolate terrain, they are pushed to the limits of human reason and intelligence by the unfathomable emptiness and impassive cruelty of the desert. Along the way, they encounter a host of enigmatic characters whose inarticulate strangeness seals the travelers off even more completely from the culture in which they are traveling, causing their fierce attachments to one another to unravel.</p><p>This special fiftieth anniversary commemorative edition of Bowles's unforgettable first novel includes the original <em>New York Times</em> review by Tennessee Williams and a preface the author wrote for his first novel before he died in 1999.</p></p><h2>Daredevil Visionaries Vol. 1: Guardian Devil</h2><p>Daredevil&#39;s faith is tested when a he finds a baby on his doorstep and must find the strength to go on after the death of his longtime lover.</p><p></p><h2>Tarzan and the Golden Lion #9</h2><p>Ballantine Books, paperback, 1979 printing with the Boris Vallejo cover art shown here.

This is Everysummer decked in all its best glory.</p><p>Picture an orderly little maze of houses on a hill, only a few miles from Dublin. Someday, the government declared, this will be a buzzing marvel of suburban vitality, a plan-perfect solution to overcrowding and poverty and every urban ill; for now it is a few handfuls of cloned semi-detacheds, still new enough to look startled and gauche on their hillside. While the government rhapsodized about McDonald&#x2019;s and multiscreens, a few young families&#x2014;escaping from the tenements and outdoor toilets that went unmentioned in 1970s Ireland, or dreaming big back gardens and hopscotch roads for their children, or just buying as close to home as a teacher&#x2019;s or bus driver&#x2019;s salary would let them&#x2014;packed rubbish bags and bumped along a two-track path, grass and daisies growing down the middle, to their mint-new start.</p><p>That was ten years ago, and the vague strobe-light dazzle of chain stores and community centers conjured up under &#x201c;infrastructure&#x201d; has so far failed to materialize (minor politicians occasionally bellow in the D�il, unreported, about shady land deals). Farmers still pasture cows across the road, and night flicks on only a sparse constellation of lights on the neighboring hillsides; behind the estate, where the someday plans show the shopping center and the neat little park, spreads a square mile and who knows how many centuries of wood.</p><p>Move closer, follow the three children scrambling over the thin membrane of brick and mortar that holds the wood back from the semi-ds. Their bodies have the perfect economy of latency; they are streamlined and unselfconscious, pared to light flying machines. White tattoos&#x2014;lightning bolt, star, A&#x2014;flash where they cut Band-Aids into shapes and let the sun brown around them. A flag of white-blond hair flies out: toehold, knee on the wall, up and over and gone.</p><p>The wood is all flicker and murmur and illusion. Its silence is a pointillist conspiracy of a million tiny noises&#x2014;rustles, flurries, nameless truncated shrieks; its emptiness teems with secret life, scurrying just beyond the corner of your eye. Careful: bees zip in and out of cracks in the leaning oak; stop to turn any stone and strange larvae will wriggle irritably, while an earnest thread of ants twines up your ankle. In the ruined tower, someone&#x2019;s abandoned stronghold, nettles thick as your wrist seize between the stones, and at dawn rabbits bring their kittens out from the foundations to play on ancient graves.</p><p>These three children own the summer. They know the wood as surely as they know the microlandscapes of their own grazed knees; put them down blindfolded in any dell or clearing and they could find their way out without putting a foot wrong. This is their territory, and they rule it wild and lordly as young animals; they scramble through its trees and hide-and-seek in its hollows all the endless day long, and all night in their dreams.</p><p>They are running into legend, into sleepover stories and nightmares parents never hear. Down the faint lost paths you would never find alone, skidding round the tumbled stone walls, they stream calls and shoelaces behind them like comet-trails. And who is it waiting on the riverbank with his hands in the willow branches, whose laughter tumbles swaying from a branch high above, whose is the face in the undergrowth in the corner of your eye, built of light and leaf-shadow, there and gone in a blink?</p><p>These children will not be coming of age, this or any other summer. This August will not ask them to find hidden reserves of strength and courage as they confront the complexity of the adult world and come away sadder and wiser and bonded for life. This summer has other requirements for them.<br><br><b>1</b></p><p>What I warn you to remember is that I am a detective. Our relationship with truth is fundamental but cracked, refracting confusingly like fragmented glass. It is the core of our careers, the endgame of every move we make, and we pursue it with strategies painstakingly constructed of lies and concealment and every variation on deception. The truth is the most desirable woman in the world and we are the most jealous lovers, reflexively denying anyone else the slightest glimpse of her. We betray her routinely, spending hours and days stupor-deep in lies, and then turn back to her holding out the lover&#x2019;s ultimate M�bius strip: But I only did it because I love you so much.</p><p>I have a pretty knack for imagery, especially the cheap, facile kind. Don&#x2019;t let me fool you into seeing us as a bunch of parfit gentil knights galloping off in doublets after Lady Truth on her white palfrey. What we do is crude, crass and nasty. A girl gives her boyfriend an alibi for the evening when we suspect him of robbing a north-side Centra and stabbing the clerk. I flirt with her at first, telling her I can see why he would want to stay home when he&#x2019;s got her; she is peroxided and greasy, with the flat, stunted features of generations of malnutrition, and privately I am thinking that if I were her boyfriend I would be relieved to trade her even for a hairy cellmate named Razor. Then I tell her we&#x2019;ve found marked bills from the till in his classy white tracksuit bottoms, and he&#x2019;s claiming that she went out that evening and gave them to him when she got back.</p><p>I do it so convincingly, with such delicate crosshatching of discomfort and compassion at her man&#x2019;s betrayal, that finally her faith in four shared years disintegrates like a sand castle and through tears and snot, while her man sits with my partner in the next interview room saying nothing except &#x201c;Fuck off, I was home with Jackie,&#x201d; she tells me everything from the time he left the house to the details of his sexual shortcomings. Then I pat her gently on the shoulder and give her a tissue and a cup of tea, and a statement sheet.</p><p>This is my job, and you don&#x2019;t go into it&#x2014;or, if you do, you don&#x2019;t last&#x2014;without some natural affinity for its priorities and demands. What I am telling you, before you begin my story, is this&#x2014;two things: I crave truth. And I lie.</p><p>This is what I read in the file, the day after I made detective. I will come back to this story again and again, in any number of different ways. A poor thing, possibly, but mine own: this is the only story in the world that nobody but me will ever be able to tell.</p><p>On the afternoon of Tuesday, August 14, 1984, three children&#x2014;Germaine (&#x201c;Jamie&#x201d;) Elinor Rowan, Adam Robert Ryan and Peter Joseph Savage, all aged twelve&#x2014;were playing in the road where their houses stood, in the small County Dublin town of Knocknaree. As it was a hot, clear day, many residents were in their gardens, and numerous witnesses saw the children at various times during the afternoon, balancing along the wall at the end of the road, riding their bicycles and swinging on a tire swing.</p><p>Knocknaree was at that time very sparsely developed, and a sizable wood adjoined the estate, separated from it by a five-foot wall. Around 3:00 p.m., the three children left their bicycles in the Savages&#x2019; front garden, telling Mrs. Angela Savage&#x2014;who was in the garden hanging washing on the line&#x2014;that they were going to play in the wood. They did this often and knew that part of the wood well, so Mrs. Savage was not worried that they would become lost. Peter had a wristwatch, and she told him to be home by 6:30 for his tea. This conversation was confirmed by her next-door neighbor, Mrs. Mary Therese Corry, and several witnesses saw the children climbing over the wall at the end of the road and going into the wood.</p><p>When Peter Savage had not returned by 6:45 his mother called around to the mothers of the other two children, assuming he had gone to one of their houses. None of the children had returned. Peter Savage was normally reliable, but the parents did not at that point become worried; they assumed that the children had become absorbed in a game and forgotten to check the time. At approximately five minutes to seven, Mrs. Savage went around to the wood by the road, walked a little way in and called the children. She heard no answer and neither saw nor heard anything to indicate any person was present in the wood.</p><p>She returned home to serve tea to her husband, Mr. Joseph Savage, and their four younger children. After tea, Mr. Savage and Mr. John Ryan, Adam Ryan&#x2019;s father, went a little further into the wood, called the children and again received no response. At 8:25, when it was beginning to grow dark, the parents became seriously worried that the children might have become lost, and Miss Alicia Rowan (Germaine&#x2019;s mother, a single parent), who had a telephone, rang the police.</p><p>A search of the wood began. There was at this point some fear that the children might have run away. Miss Rowan had decided that Germaine was to go to boarding school in Dublin, remaining there during the week and returning to Knocknaree at weekends; she had been scheduled to leave two weeks later, and all three children had been very upset at the thought of being separated. However, a preliminary search of the children&#x2019;s rooms revealed that no clothing, money or personal items appeared to be missing. Germaine&#x2019;s piggy bank, in the form of a Russian doll, contained �5.85 and was intact.</p><p>At 10:20 p.m. a policeman with a torch found Adam Ryan in a densely wooded area near the center of the wood, standing with his back and palms pressed against a large oak tree. His fingernails were digging into the trunk so deeply that they had broken off in the bark. He appeared to have been there for some time but had not responded to the searchers&#x2019; calling. He was taken to hospital. The Dog Unit was called in and tracked the two missing children to a point not far from where Adam Ryan had been found; there the dogs became confused and lost the scent.</p><p>When I was found I was wearing blue denim shorts, a white cotton T-shirt, white cotton socks and white lace-up running shoes. The shoes were heavily bloodstained, the socks less heavily. Later analysis of the staining patterns showed that the blood had soaked through the shoes from the inside outwards; it had soaked through the socks, in lesser concentrations, from the outside in. The implication was that the shoes had been removed and blood had spilled into them; some time later, when it had begun to coagulate, the shoes had been replaced on my feet, thus transferring blood to the socks. The T-shirt showed four parallel tears, between three and five inches in length, running diagonally across the back from the mid-left shoulder blade to the right back ribs.</p><p>I was uninjured except for some minor scratches on my calves, splinters (later found to be consistent with the wood of the oak tree) under my fingernails, and a deep abrasion on each kneecap, both beginning to form scabs. There was some uncertainty as to whether the grazes had been made in the wood or not, as a younger child (Aideen Watkins, aged five) who had been playing in the road stated that she had seen me fall from a wall earlier that day, landing on my knees. However, her statement varied with retelling and was not considered reliable. I was also near-catatonic: I made no voluntary movement for almost thirty-six hours and did not speak for a further two weeks. When I did, I had no memory of anything between leaving home that afternoon and being examined in the hospital.</p><p>The blood on my shoes and socks was tested for ABO type&#x2014;DNA analysis was not a possibility in Ireland in 1984&#x2014;and found to be type A positive. My blood was also found to be type A positive; however, it was judged to be unlikely that the abrasions on my knees, although deep, could have drawn enough blood to cause the heavy soaking in the running shoes. Germaine Rowan&#x2019;s blood had been tested prior to an appendectomy two years earlier, and her records showed that she was also A positive. Peter Savage, though no blood type was on record for him, was eliminated as the source of the stains: both his parents were found to be type O, making it impossible that he could be anything else. In the absence of conclusive identification, investigators could not eliminate the possibility that the blood had come from a fourth individual, nor the possibility that it originated from multiple sources.</p><p>The search continued throughout the night of August 14 and for weeks thereafter&#x2014;teams of volunteers combed the nearby fields and hills, every known bog hole and bog drain in the area was explored, divers searched the river that ran through the wood&#x2014;with no result. Fourteen months later, Mr. Andrew Raftery, a local resident walking his dog in the wood, spotted a wristwatch in the undergrowth about two hundred feet from the tree where I had been found. The watch was distinctive&#x2014;the face showed a cartoon of a footballer in action, and the second-hand was tipped with a football&#x2014;and Mr. and Mrs. Savage identified it as having belonged to their son Peter. Mrs. Savage confirmed that he had been wearing it on the afternoon of his disappearance. The watch&#x2019;s plastic strap appeared to have been torn from the metal face with some force, possibly by catching on a low branch when Peter was running. The Technical Bureau identified a number of partial fingerprints on the strap and face; all were consistent with prints found on Peter Savage&#x2019;s belongings.</p><p>Despite numerous police appeals and a high-profile media campaign, no other trace of Peter Savage and Germaine Rowan was ever found.</p><p>I became a policeman because I wanted to be a Murder detective. My time in training and in uniform&#x2014;Templemore College, endless complicated physical exercises, wandering around small towns in a cartoonish Day-Glo jacket, investigating which of the three unintelligible local delinquents had broken Mrs. McSweeney&#x2019;s garden-shed window&#x2014;all felt like an embarrassing daze scripted by Ionesco, a trial by tedium I had to endure, for some dislocated bureaucratic reason, in order to earn my actual job. I never think about those years and cannot remember them with any clarity. I made no friends; to me my detachment from the whole process felt involuntary and inevitable, like the side effect of a sedative drug, but the other cops read it as deliberate superciliousness, a studied sneer at their solid rural backgrounds and solid rural ambitions. Possibly it was. I recently found a dia...</p></p><h2>More Than This</h2><p>THIS IS BRAND NEW BOOK.WE PROVIDE 100% CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.</p><p>Patrick Ness is the author of the critically acclaimed and bestselling Chaos Walking trilogy, as well as the Carnegie Medal-winning A Monster Calls, inspired by an idea from Siobhan Dowd. Among the numerous awards he has received are the Guardian Children&#39;s Fiction Prize, the Booktrust Teenage Prize, and the Costa Children&#39;s Book Award. Born in Virginia, he lives in London.Gr 9 Up&#x2013;This haunting and consistently surprising novel raises deep questions about what it means to be alive, but it doesn't try to console readers with easy or pat answers. As the story opens, teenage Seth is experiencing his own death in painful detail. In the next chapter, he wakes up physically weak, covered in bandages and strange wounds, and wonders if he is in Hell or the future or somewhere else entirely. As he tries to survive in and make sense of his strange yet familiar surroundings, he is plagued by intense flashbacks of his life before he died: his guilt over the tragedy that befell his little brother, his burgeoning romance with another boy in his small town, and the events that led to his (dubious) death. Upon discovering two other young people in the blighted place he's landed, Seth begins to learn the Matrix-like truth about what has happened to the rest of humanity, how he can escape, and whether he even wants to. The intense themes in this novel make it more appropriate for older teens, but the language and sexual scenarios are clear, relevant, and neither graphic or gratuitous. A delicate balance between dystopian survival and philosophical grappling means that many different kinds of readers should appreciate the story.&#x2013;Kyle Lukoff, Corlears School, New York City&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

The outspoken strong-girl with the carrot-colored pigtails and the mismatched socks has enthralled generations of children the world over with her fabulous exploits at Villa Villekulla, where she lives with her horse and monkey. Countless translations of the chapter books are available in more than sixty languages. Pippi is Sweden's best-known children's export, making it all the more remarkable that D+Q has discovered what will be a three-volume series.</p><p>The comics are re-imaginings of the classic chapter book stories and were originally published in the Swedish magazine Humpty Dumpty in 1957&#x2013;1959, a decade after the original books. The comics spotlight both Lindgren's brilliant writing and Vang Nyman's bold bright colors that seem presciently and eerily modern. The original illustrator for the chapter books, Vang Nyman was an avant-garde champion of the importance of children's literature who insisted that art in children's books needed to meet the same esthetic standards as art in any other medium. Sadly Vang Nyman never achieved international success, and tragically committed suicide in 1959 due to mental health issues, while Lindgren went on to become one of the world's best-loved writers with more than 145 million books sold worldwide.</p><p>Similar to D+Q's 2005 unearthing of the Tove Jansson's Moomin comic strip, which has more than 100,000 units in print, these mid-century classics are waiting to be discovered and enjoyed by the world's legions of Pippi fans, both young and old.</p></p><p><p><b>Astrid Lindgren </b>(1907&#x2013;2002) was the creator of one of Sweden's most iconic fictional characters, Pippi Longstocking.

Although they may be a tough sell to today's audiences, the collection will pair nicely with the novels and might serve to generate some interest in the character. Over the course of 12 short stories, readers get to know the quirky world of Pippi Longstocking. The opening selection tells the story of when Pippi; her horse; and monkey sidekick, Mr. Nillson, moved in next to everyday kids Tommy and Annika. Everything about Pippi is unusual, from her super strength to her curious lack of parents. The following comics explore different aspects of her personality, from defeating the strongest man in the world to getting shipwrecked on purpose. Pippi's dialogue is simple, brief, and full of quips. The basic humor and kids vs. adults situations have the potential to draw in readers. The artwork is bold, with heavy doses of primary colors. The layouts are easy to follow, with the exception of an oddly placed caption box here and there. It's great to see these comics available to American audiences. Wide appeal will be elusive, but fans of Pippi and classic comics will be pleased.-Travis Jonker, Wayland Union Schools, MI&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Born in New York City, Menashe practiced his art of "compression and crystallization" (in Derek Mahon's phrase) in poems that are brief in form but startlingly wide-ranging and profound in their engagement with ultimate questions. Dana Gioia has written: "Menashe is essentially a religious poet, though one without an orthodox creed. Nearly every poem he has ever published radiates a heightened religious awareness." Intensely musical and rigorously constructed, Menashe's poetry stands apart in its solitary meditative power. But it is equally a poetry of the everyday, suffused, in the words of Christopher Ricks, with "the courage of comedy, flanked by the respect of innocence." The humblest of objects, the minutest of natural forms here become powerfully suggestive, and even the shortest of the poems are spacious in the perspectives they open.<br><br><b>About the American Poets Project</b><br>Elegantly designed in compact editions, printed on acid-free paper, and textually authoritative, the American Poets Project makes available the full range of the American poetic accomplishment, selected and introduced by today&#x2019;s most discerning poets and critics.</p><p><b>Christopher Ricks</b>, editor of this volume, is Warren Professor of the Humanities and co-director of the Editorial Institute at Boston University, and the author of many distinguished works of criticism, including&nbsp;<i>Milton&#x2019;s Grand Style</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Force of Poetry.</i></p><h2>Talking with God: Divine Conversations that Transform Daily Life</h2><p>Even when we believe in the value of prayer, many of us do not make it a priority or long for a more meaningful prayer life.

The book is riveting on several levels: John Walker's uncanny ability to talk three people into betraying their country (his brother Arthur, son Michael and best friend Jerry Whitworth, all of whom, along with ringleader Walker, are now serving life sentences); the appalling ease with which top-secret documents were copied and passed along to the Soviets over a period of 17 years; Whitworth's withdrawal from the organization, his abortive attempt to blow the whistle and his subsequent effort to rejoin it; Barbara Walker's struggle to convince the FBI to believe her charges against her ex-husband; and John Walker's grotesque rationalizations and self-justification in his interviews with Earley.

First serial to the Washington Post; CBS-TV miniseries. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc."Of all the spies in America," said John Walker's KGB handler, "you, John, are the best!" In this journalistic account Earley (a former Washington Post staff writer) examines up close the evolution and self-destruction of this damaging collection of banal traitors. The story is sprinkled with tales of dead drops and top secret lists and packed with profanities. What Earley lacks in analysis, he makes up for in storytelling. Based on interviews with Walker, his family, and Jerry Whitworth (another key conspirator), and trial transcripts, this engrossing book compares favorably with Howard Blum's I Pledge Allegiance: The True Story of the Walker's (LJ 11/1/87) in discussing the psychological impact of the case.

Throughout her lives, Gilda is a woman of African descent with strong feminist traits and a sense of loyalty to her friends and family, both mortal and immortal. In her first life, she is a runaway slave in Louisiana in 1850, not yet a vampire, not yet named, who stabs a rapist/bounty hunter in self-defense. Rescued and adopted by Gilda, a vampire who runs a brothel, she soon becomes a vampire herself and adopts Gilda's name. Subsequent lives take Gilda to California in 1890, Missouri in 1921, Massachusetts in 1955, New York in 1981 where she does a stint as a cabaret singer, and into the future in New Hampshire in 2020 and up to the year 2050. Gomez provides an unusual twist to the erotic vampire novel, introducing issues of race and sexual preference, but there is no attempt to address these issues except as fodder for an ultimately uninteresting romance novel. This is Gomez's first novel; she is a poet and the author of Flamingoes and Bears. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.The Gilda Stories is an elegant, sensual, and natural vampire fantasy. Time-traveling from Southern slavery in 1850 to environmental devastation 200 years later, Gilda is the quintessential outsider seeking community. Jewelle Gomez combines a natural flair for storyteller with an ability to weave tapestries of personality that grab the mind's imagination and won't let go.

The dissolute landowner Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov is murdered; his sons--the atheist intellectual Ivan, the hot-blooded Dmitry, and the saintly novice Alyosha--are all involved at some level. Brilliantly bound up with this psychological drama is Dostoevsky's intense and disturbing exploration of many deeply felt ideas about the existence of God, freedom of will, the collective nature of guilt, and the disastrous consequences of rationalism. Filled with eloquent voices, this new translation fully realizes the power and dramatic virtuosity of Dostoevsky's most brilliant work.</p><p><br>Born in Latvia but now living in London, Ignat Avsey is Senior Lecturer in Russian language and Literature at the University of Westminster.<br>CHAPTER 1<br>FYODOR PAVLOVICH KARAMAZOV<br>ALexei Fyodorovich Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov, a landowner in our district who became a celebrity (and is remembered to this day) because of the tragic and mysterious end he met exactly thirteen years ago, which will be described in its proper place. For the moment, I will only say of this "landowner" (as they referred to him here, although he spent hardly any time on his land) that he belonged to a peculiar though widespread human type, the sort of man who is not only wretched and depraved but also muddle-headed--muddle-headed in a way that allows him to pull off all sorts of shady little financial deals and not much else.<br><br>Fyodor Karamazov, for instance, started with next to nothing; he was just about the lowliest landowner among us, a man who would dash off to dine at other people's tables whenever he was given a chance and who sponged off people as much as he could. Yet, at his death, they found that he had a hundred thousand rubles in hard cash. And with all that, throughout his life he remained one of the most muddle-headed eccentrics in our entire district. Let me repeat: it was not stupidity, for most such eccentrics are really quite intelligent and cunning, and their lack of common sense is of a special kind, a national variety.<br><br>He had been married twice and had three sons--the eldest, Dmitry, by his first wife, and the other two, Ivan and Alexei, by the second.<br><br>Fyodor Karamazov's first wife came from a fairly wealthy family of landed gentry--the Miusovs--also from our district. Why should a girl with a dowry, a beautiful girl moreover, one of those bright, clever young things who in this generation are no longer rare and who even cropped up occasionally in the last--why should she marry such a worthless "freak," as they called him? I will not really attempt to explain. But, then, I once knew a young lady of the old, "romantic" generation who, after several years of secret love for a gentleman whom, please note, she could have peacefully married at any moment she chose, invented insurmountable obstacles for herself and, one stormy night, jumped from a steep, rather cliff-like bank into a fairly deep, rapid river and drowned, all because she fancied herself an Ophelia out of Shakespeare. Indeed, if the bank, on which she had had her eye for a long time, had been less picturesque or had there simply been a flat bank, it is conceivable that the suicide would never have taken place at all. This is a true story, and it must be assumed that in the past two or three generations quite a few similar incidents have occurred. In the same way, what Adelaida Miusov did was undoubtedly an echo of outside influences and also the act of exasperation of a captive mind. Perhaps she was trying to display feminine independence, to rebel against social conventions, against the despotism of her family and relatives, while her ready imagination convinced her, if only for a moment, that Fyodor Karamazov, despite his reputation as a sponger, was nevertheless one of the boldest and most caustic men of that "period of transition toward better things," whereas in reality he was nothing but a nasty buffoon. The fact that the marriage plans included elopement added piquancy to it, making it more exciting for Adelaida. Fyodor, at that time, would, of course, have done anything to improve his lowly position, and the opportunity to latch on to a good family and to pocket a dowry was extremely tempting to him. As for love, there does not seem to have been any, either on the bride's part or, despite her beauty, on Karamazov's. This was perhaps a unique case in Fyodor Karamazov's life, for he was as sensual as a man can be, one who throughout his life was always prepared, at the slightest encouragement, to chase any skirt. But his wife just happened to be the one woman who did not appeal to him sensually in the least.<br><br>Right after the elopement, Adelaida realized that she felt nothing but scorn for her husband. It quickly became obvious what married life was to be. Despite the fact that her family accepted the situation quite soon and gave the runaway bride her dowry, relations between husband and wife became an everlasting succession of quarrels. It was rumored that, in these quarrels, the young wife displayed incomparably more dignity and generosity than her husband, who, it was found out later, soon wheedled out of her every kopek of the twenty-five thousand rubles she had received, so that, as far as she was concerned, those thousands were sunk in deep waters never to be salvaged again. As to the little country estate and the quite decent town house that were also part of her dowry, he kept trying desperately to have them transferred to his name by some suitable deed; he probably would have succeeded because of the loathing and disgust his constant pleading and begging inspired in his wife, because she would do anything to have peace, sick and tired as she was of him; but luckily Adelaida's family intervened in time to put a stop to his greed.<br><br>People knew that husband and wife often came to actual blows and rumor had it that it was she who beat him, rather than he her. Indeed, Adelaida was a hot-tempered, bold, dark, and impatient lady endowed with remarkable physical strength.<br><br>Finally she eloped with a half-starved tutor, a former divinity student, leaving her husband with their three-year-old boy, Mitya.<br><br>Fyodor Karamazov immediately installed a regular harem in the house and indulged in the most scandalous drunken debauchery. But between one orgy and the next, he would drive all over the province complaining tearfully to all and sundry of Adelaida's desertion, and revealing on these occasions certain unsavory intimate details of their conjugal life that any other husband would have been ashamed to mention. He even seemed to enjoy--indeed, to feel flattered by--his ridiculous role as a cuckolded husband, for he insisted on describing his own disgrace in minute detail, even embellishing on it. "Why, Fyodor Pavlovich," people remarked, "you act as if an honor had been bestowed upon you. You seem pleased despite your sorrow." Many even added that he was delighted to have the role of clown thrust upon him, that he only pretended to be unaware of his ridiculous position in order to make it even funnier. But who can really tell? Possibly he was quite ingenuous about it all.<br><br>He finally succeeded in getting on the track of his runaway wife. It led to Petersburg where the poor thing had moved with her divinity student and where she had abandoned herself to a life of complete emancipation. Fyodor Karamazov immediately busied himself with preparations for the journey to Petersburg, and perhaps he would have gone, although he certainly had no idea what he would do there. But once he had decided to go, he felt that he had a special reason for plunging into a bout of unrestrained drunkenness--to fortify himself for the journey. And just at that time his in-laws received word that Adelaida had died in Petersburg. She died suddenly, in a garret, of typhus according to some, of starvation according to others. Karamazov was drunk when he learned of his wife's death, and some say he exclaimed joyfully, raising his hands to heaven: "Lord, now let Your servant depart in peace." But according to others, he wept, sobbing like a little boy so that people felt sorry for him despite the disgust he aroused in them. It is quite possible that they all were right, that he rejoiced in his regained freedom and wept for the woman from whom he had been freed, both at once. In most cases, people, even the most vicious, are much more naive and simple-minded than we assume them to be. And this is true of ourselves too.<br>CHAPTER 2<br>HE GETS RID OF HIS ELDEST SON<br>It is, of course, easy to imagine what sort of a father such a man would be, how he would bring up his children. And he lived up to expectation: he completely and thoroughly neglected his child by Adelaida. He did not do so out of any deliberate malice or resentment toward the child's mother, but simply because he forgot all about the little boy. And while he was pestering people with his tears and self-pitying stories, while he was turning his home into a house of debauchery, a faithful servant of the household, Gregory, took the three-year-old Mitya into his care. If it hadn't been for Gregory, there would have been no one to change the boy's shirt. Moreover, it so happened that the child's relations on his mother's side had also, at first, forgotten his existence. Mitya's grandfather, that is, Adelaida's father, Mr. Miusov, was no longer alive; his widow, Mitya's grandmother, had moved to Moscow and was in very poor health; and, in the meantime, Adelaida's sisters had married and moved away. So Mitya spent almost a year in Gregory's little house in the servants' quarters. And, even if his father had occasionally remembered him (he could not, after all, have been completely unaware of the child's existence), Karamazov would have sent his son back to the servants' quarters anyway, because a child would have been in the way during the orgies.<br><br>But one day a first cousin of Adelaida's returned from Paris. Peter Miusov, who was later to settle abroad permanently, was at that time still a young man, but he was already an exception among the Miusovs: he was an enlightened, big-city gentleman, glittering with foreign polish, a European through and through who, later in life, was to become a typical liberal of the 1840's and 1850's. In the course of his life, he came in contact with some of the most liberal minds of his era, both in Russia and abroad. He met Proudhon personally, as well as Bakunin, and, toward the end of his wanderings, liked best to tell of his experiences during the three days of the February Revolution of 1848 which he had witnessed in Paris, implying that he himself had taken part in it, just short, perhaps, of manning the barricades. This was one of the most gratifying recollections of his youth. He was a man of independent means, with an income from an estate of a thousand-odd souls, as property was evaluated in the old days. That splendid estate was located just outside our town and bordered on the lands of our famous monastery. No sooner had young Peter Miusov taken possession of his estate than he started an endless lawsuit against the monastery. It was something about fishing privileges or wood-cutting rights, I'm not sure which, but he felt that in suing "clericals" he was doing his duty as a citizen and an enlightened man.<br><br>When Miusov heard what had happened to Adelaida, whom he, of course, remembered, having even, at one time, taken a special interest in her, and when he learned of Mitya's plight, he decided to intervene, although that involved approaching Karamazov, whom Miusov loathed and despised with all the ardor of youth. This was the first time that he met Fyodor Karamazov; he told him point blank that he wished to take the boy and be responsible for his education. Later, he liked to tell at length what had happened at that meeting, because he felt it revealed a great deal about Karamazov's character. When Miusov first broached the subject of Mitya, the fellow stared at him blankly, as though he could not understand what child Miusov was talking about, and he seemed positively taken aback when reminded that he had a young son. And although Miusov's story may have been exaggerated, there was certainly an element of truth in it. It is a fact that all his life Karamazov liked to act the fool and assume all sorts of surprising roles; he would do so even when he had nothing to gain, indeed, even when it could be positively to his disadvantage, as in this instance. This is a quirk found in many people, even very clever ones, let alone the likes of Fyodor Karamazov.<br><br>Miusov at first went about the matter with some zest, and was even appointed Mitya's guardian (jointly with Karamazov), since the boy had, after all, the small estate and the town house coming to him as his inheritance from his mother. And he moved the boy to his house. But, not being tied down by a family of his own, just as soon as he had wound up his business in our town, which consisted of collecting the revenue from his estate, he went dashing off to Paris for a long stay. He left the boy in the care of a relative of his, a lady who lived in Moscow. Miusov settled in Paris for good and lost sight of Mitya, his interest in the boy petering out completely after the February Revolution, which made such an ineradicable impression on him. In the meantime, the Moscow lady died and Mitya passed into the care of one of her married daughters. I believe he had to change homes for a fourth time soon afterward. I won't expand on this topic here since I will have a great deal to say later about this first-born son of Fyodor Karamazov's, but I must supply a few facts right away, without which I could not even begin my novel.<br><br>First of all, Mitya--that is, Dmitry Fyodorovich Karamazov--was the only one of Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov's sons who grew up under the impression that, however hard up he might be, he would, when he came of age, come into his inheritance from his mother and that he would then be financially independent. He was unruly as a boy and as a young man. He dropped out of the classical secondary school, but later was admitted to military school. From there he was sent on active duty with an army unit in the Caucasus, where he was given an officer's commission in the field. He was soon demoted to the ranks for fighting a duel, only to be restored to his rank again for gallantry. After this he led a wild, gay life that cost a good deal of money. Since, until he came of age, he never received a single kopek from his father, he was deep in debt by the time that day arrived. He only met and got to know the old man when he came to our town to demand an accounting of the estate left him by his mother. It would appear that, even then, Dmitry took a dislike to his father. He stayed at the paternal house only a short time, leaving as soon as he had managed to get a very small sum from the old man, together with some vague agreement about sending him the revenue from his estate. It must be noted here that on this occasion Dmitry failed to find out from his father what the total worth of his estate was or what income it yielded. Karamazov discovered right away (and this must be noted too) that his son had an erroneous and exaggerated notion of his inheritance, and this discovery pleased him for it fitted in with his own schemes. He realized that the young man was irresponsible, violent, passionate, unruly, impatient, and that he couldn't wait to satisfy all his whims and impulses. And Karamazov now knew how to handle Dmitry: the fellow could always be placated, at least temporarily, with small handouts. Karamazov proceeded immediately to exploit his son's weakness, putting him off with small sums. This went on for four years until, finally, Dmitry lost patience. He made a second appearance in town, this time to force on his father a final settlement of their accounts. He was quite stunned to hear from Karamazov that he had already received, in the many installments, a sum amounting to the value of his estate, that, if anything, it was he who was now in debt to his father, and that, moreover, in view of such and such an agreement which he himself had insisted upon at one point, he had renounced all further claims, etc., etc. The young man was dumbfounded, accused his father of cheating him, and acted as if he would go out of his mind.</p><h2>How I Got My Shrunken Head (Classic Goosebumps #10) (10)</h2><p>Discover the bone-chilling adventures that made Goosebumps one of the bestselling children's book series of all time.

He is the author of two <b>New York Times</b> bestsellers, <b>Citizen Hughes</b> and <b>The Bible Code</b>. He lives and works in New York City.CHAPTER ONE <p> At 8:48 A.M. on September 11, 2001 I was awakened by the sound of an explosion that changed the world forever. </p><p> I turned on my clock radio and heard a news bulletin-a jumbo jet had crashed into one of the World Trade Center towers. </p><p> I ran up to my roof just in time to see a second Boeing 767 fly right into the second of the Twin Towers, setting it ablaze. It was obviously no accident. The two planes had been hijacked by terrorists. New York was under attack. </p><p> For more than an hour I stood alone on my roof and watched with increasing horror and disbelief as those two 110-story buildings, the silver monoliths that loomed over Lower Manhattan where I live, continued to burn, shooting giant orange flames out of the gaping holes, spewing huge plumes of black smoke up into the sky. </p><p> Suddenly, one of the towers collapsed. It just fell straight down. And then the second tower also imploded. They both disappeared in a cloud of dust that rushed up the street right toward me. In an instant they were gone. </p><p> My mind could not take in the scale of the destruction my eyes had seen. It was on a scale only captured in Biblical prophecy. </p><p> I ran down from the roof and immediately searched the ancient code on my computer, the Bible code. It was the one place I might find confirmation of the full danger, and a revelation of what was yet to come. </p><p> The hidden code, discovered in the Bible by a famous Israeli mathematician, had already revealed other world-shaking events that took place thousands of years after the Bible was written. </p><p> Now it revealed the entire event I had just witnessed. What I watched from my roof only minutes earlier, was there in detail on my computer screen in ancient Hebrew characters. </p><p> "Twin Towers" was encoded in the 3000-year-old text. "Airplane" appeared in exactly the same place. "It caused to fall, knocked down" crossed "airplane" and "towers." </p><p> What I saw happen with my own eyes on September 11, 2001 was encoded in the Bible 3000 years ago. </p><p>As I watched it all happen, I had only one thought, and when the first tower fell I said it out loud-"Oh my God, it's real." </p><p>It was not this terrorist attack that really shook me. It was what the Bible code predicted was yet to come. </p><p>It had already predicted the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Yitzhak Rabin. Everything from World War II to Watergate, from the Holocaust to Hiroshima, from the Moon landing to the Gulf War, had been foreseen. Sometimes the predictions were found in advance, and the events happened exactly as predicted. </p><p>And now every detail of September 11 was there, too. Suddenly, brutally, I had absolute proof that the Bible code was real. </p><p>So when the planes slammed into the towers, as I watched the horror begin to unfold, I also saw visions of a future too terrible to imagine, but clearly foretold in the code. And suddenly, it all seemed totally plausible. </p><p>For five years I had been warning world leaders that an ancient prophecy was about to come true, that the Apocalypse foretold by all the West's three major religions was encoded in the Bible, that we might face the real Armageddon-a nuclear World War starting with an act of terrorism in the Middle East-within a decade. But I could not fully believe it myself. </p><p>President Clinton had my book with him at Camp David, and my letter warning him that we faced a war in the Holy Land that could engulf the entire world. </p><p> "I hesitate to state it in detail, because it sounds so Apocalyptic," I told Clinton, holding something back even as I warned him. I could not bring myself to tell the President the world might come to an end. </p><p> Yet just within the past year I had finally told the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of Israel, and the leader of the Palestinians that according to the Bible code we were already in the ultimate time of danger, the End of Days. </p><p> I had sat with Yasir Arafat in his embattled headquarters in Ramallah, and with Shimon Peres in Tel Aviv, and with Ariel Sharon's son in Jerusalem, and with Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff in the White House, and told them all that we might have only five years left to save the world. </p><p> But no one would heed the warning. </p><p> Just the day before the September 11 attack I had talked to the White House again to see if the new President, George W. Bush, had received a letter I sent him, warning that we might face World War III while he was in office. </p><p> My letter to Bush, sent more than a month before Arab terrorists struck New York and Washington, stated: </p><p> "Now the Bible code warns that the world may face its ultimate danger-a nuclear World War starting in the Middle East-while you are in office. </p><p> "This critical moment was without doubt clearly foreseen. </p><p> "'Bush,' 'Arafat,' and 'Sharon' are all encoded together by name in the Bible with the time of danger long foretold by all three major Western religions-the 'End of Days.' </p><p> "And the Bible code clearly states the danger in modern terms- 'atomic holocaust' and 'World War' are both encoded in the Bible. And both are encoded with the same year, 2006." </p><p> On September 11 the President himself said that we were at war, that the "first war of the twenty-first century has begun." And a column in the New York Times was headlined "WORLD WAR III." </p><p> But until September 11 I never entirely believed it myself. I am not religious. I don't believe in God. I'm a secular, skeptical investigative reporter. I started out on the night police beat at the <i>Washington Post</i>, I covered corporate news at the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and I still have a flat-footed sense of reality. So although I wrote a book that made the Bible code known to the world, I woke up every morning doubting the danger was real. </p><p> On the morning of September 11 I was awakened by the event that proved it real. </p><p> Suddenly there was no room for doubt. It wasn't just Israel, it was the United States, it was New York. It was the city where I lived. It was just down the block. And I saw it happen with my own eyes. </p><p> The attack on New York, the attack on the World Trade Center, this unbelievable horror was not only encoded in the Bible-I had actually seen it in advance. </p><p> I had found it in 1993, right after the failed terrorist attack on the same two towers. "Twin Towers" was encoded in the Bible with "the warning, the slaughter," and that was crossed by "terror." "Terror" appeared a second time, and "it will fall, collapse" was also encoded twice. </p><p> But I assumed it was about the past, not the future. It never occurred to me that lightning would strike twice-that there would be another terrorist attack on the same two monoliths eight years later, that it would succeed, and knock both towers down. </p><p> And I never thought to look in the code for "airplane." As I explained to a friend at the CIA later that day, "No one could have imagined it would be done that way." "Someone did," he said. </p><p> After it happened, the warning was clear. It had been hidden in the Bible for 3000 years. Now it was obvious. Every detail was there. </p><p> The scientist who discovered the Bible code, Eliyahu Rips, found the same extraordinary code table on September 11 at his home in Jerusalem, and e-mailed it to me from Israel. </p><p> When I spoke to Dr. Rips, one of the world's leading authorities in group theory, a field of math that underlies quantum physics, he told me that he had calculated the odds. </p><p> The odds against the three key words-"twin" and "towers" and "airplane"-all appearing together in exactly the same place in the Bible, the odds against it happening by chance, were at least 10,000 to 1. </p><p> There was more. Osama bin Laden was named in the Bible code. Rips had found a single code sequence that declared him guilty-"the sin, the crime of bin Laden"-and it appeared in Genesis where the plain text told of "the city and the tower." </p><p> Also, in the same place, the original words of the Bible stated, "They saw the smoke rising above the land like the smoke of a furnace." </p><p> The leader of the hijackers, the pilot of the first plane that hit the towers, Mohammed Atta, was also identified. </p><p> "Terrorist Atta" was encoded in the Bible, and "Egyptian man" appeared in the same place. </p><p> There was another target, the headquarters of the American military in Washington. The Pentagon was struck by a third hijacked plane an hour after the first attack in New York. That, too, was encoded. </p><p> "Pentagon" appeared once in the Bible, crossed by "damaged." Again, the prediction in the 3000 year old text was exact. One of the five sides of the Pentagon had fallen, but the building itself still stood. </p><p> "Emergency" appeared with "Pentagon," immediately followed by "from Arabia." In fact, it was learned in the next few days that most of the terrorists had come from Saudi Arabia. </p><p> The warning of the greatest terrorist attack in the history of the world, of the first foreign attack on mainland America in modern times, had been encoded in the Bible for 3000 years. But we had missed it, until it was too late. </p><p> And now the code warned that it would lead to war. "The next war" crossed the Hebrew name for the World Trade Towers, "the Twins." "Terrorist" was encoded in the same place. </p><p> The statement in the code was chilling. This terrorist attack was the start of a new war, the war that Bush declared, a war against terrorism that many were predicting would last years. </p><p> And now I saw the encoding that captured the full horror of this moment. "Towers" and "the Twins" again appeared together in exactly the same place as the words in the plain text of the Bible that again made clear that the final countdown had begun-"in the End of Days." </p><p> For years I had been warning top government leaders in Washington and in the Middle East that the world might be facing danger on a scale only captured in Biblical prophecy, and now I had seen the reality begin to unfold with my own eyes, just down the block from my home in New York. </p><p> And I was certain that this was the beginning of something too horrible for any of us to fully imagine, not the end. </p><p> "A cryptogram set by the Almighty," the "riddle of the Godhead, the riddle of past and future events divinely fore-ordained." </p><p> That's what Sir Isaac Newton called the Bible code. Three hundred years ago Newton, the first modern scientist, the man who discovered gravity and figured out the mechanics of our solar system, who single-handedly invented advanced mathematics, searched for a hidden code in the Bible that would reveal the future of mankind. </p><p> For more than 3000 years, ever since there's been a Bible, people have believed there was something hidden in it, great secrets that were known only to the high priests, new revelations that could be found using some esoteric formula, some form of magic, some new science. </p><p> But it remained for a Russian immigrant to Israel, Eliyahu Rips, a mathematician freed from a Soviet political prison, to find the code that had eluded everyone for millennia. </p><p> Rips succeeded because he had the one essential tool that everyone before him lacked-a computer. </p><p> The Bible code had a time lock. It could not be opened until the computer was invented. </p><p> It was designed, apparently by some intelligence that could see the future, to be opened now. That much seemed clear. The code could have been designed to be found by Newton 300 years ago. Or it could have been designed to be found 300 or 3000 years in the future, by a technology that would not exist until then. </p><p> Instead, some intelligence that could see across time encoded the Bible in a way that allowed us to crack the code at this one moment in human history. </p><p> "That is why Isaac Newton could not do it," said Rips. "It had to be opened with a computer. It was 'sealed until the time of the End.'" </p><p> But when Eli Rips began his search for the Bible code nearly twenty years ago, he was not thinking about the "End of Days." </p><p> He was just solving a mathematical puzzle. "I found words encoded far more than statistics allowed for by random chance, and I knew that I was on to something of real importance," recalled Rips. "When I applied a computer, I made the breakthrough." </p><p> Rips discovered the Bible code in the original Hebrew version of the Old Testament, the Bible as it was first written, the words that according to the Bible itself God gave to Moses on Mount Sinai 3200 years ago. </p><p> Rips eliminated all the spaces between the words, and turned the entire original Bible into one continuous letter strand, 304,805 letters long. </p><p> In doing that, he was actually restoring the Bible to what ancient sages say was its original form. According to legend, it was the way Moses received the Bible from God-"contiguous, without break of words." </p><p> Rips wrote a computer program that searched the strand of letters for new information revealed by skipping any equal number of letters. </p><p> Anyone could make up a sentence that would tell one story on the surface, but another story hidden in a simple skip code. For example: </p><p> Rips explained that each code is a case of adding every fifth or tenth or fiftieth letter to form a word. </p><p> Now read that same sentence as a four-letter skip code: </p><p> Rips ExplAineD thaT eacH codE is a Case Of adDing Every fifth or tenth or fiftieth letter to form a word. </p><p> The hidden message-READ THE CODE. </p><p> But no one, not even Newton, could go through the whole Bible counting letters by hand, checking every possible skip sequence, starting with every letter from the first verse to the last verse, backwards and forwards, from the beginning of the Bible to the end. Only a computer can search fast enough to make the job possible. </p><p> And only a computer could find the complexly interwoven information in the Bible code. Time after time related words, names, dates, and places are, against all odds, encoded together. </p><p> The words form a crossword puzzle. Each time a new word or phrase is discovered, a new crossword puzzle is created. And the connected words reveal accurate, often detailed information about modern events. </p><p> It's what makes the Bible code unique. In another book one might find a random skip sequence that spells "Twin Towers"-but not with "airplane." One might find "bin Laden"-but not with "the city and the tower." One might find "the Twins"-but not with "the next war," or "the End of Days." </p><p> "Only in the Bible code is there consistent, coherent information," said Rips. "No one has found anything like that in any other book, in any translation, or in any original Hebrew text, except the Bible." </p><p> When Rips reported his discovery in an American mathematics journal, many scientists were skeptical. They couldn't fault his science, but they couldn't believe his results. The claim was just too amazing-a code in the Bible that revealed events that happened after the Bible was written. </p><p> A senior code-breaker at the top secret National Security Agency, the clandestine U.S. government listening post near Washington, heard about the startling claim, and decided to investigate. </p><p> Harold Gans had s...</p></p><h2>Cardcaptor Sakura: Master of the Clow, Book 5</h2><p>After retrieving all of the evil Clow Cards, fifth-grader Sakura, Master of the Clow, must now face the challenges sent by Clow Reed, the creator of the Clow Cards, while also dealing with her love for older student Yukito.</p><p></p><h2>A Bold Fresh Piece of Humanity</h2><p><p>The year was 1957, the month September, and I had just turned eight years old. Dwight Eisenhower was President, but in my life it was the diminutive, intense Sister Mary Lurana who ruled, at least in the third-grade class where I was held captive. For reasons you will soon understand, my parents had remanded me to the penal institution of St. Brigid&#x2019;s School in Westbury, New York, a cruel and unusual punishment if there ever was one. <br><br>Already, I had barely survived my first two years at St. Brigid&#x2019;s because I was, well, a little nitwit. Not satisfied with memorizing the Baltimore Catechism&#x2019;s fine prose, which featured passages like &#x201c;God made me to show his goodness and to make me happy with him in heaven,&#x201d; I was constantly annoying my classmates and, of course, the no-nonsense Sister Lurana. With sixty overactive students in her class, she was understandably short on patience. For survival, she had also become quick on the draw.<br><br>Then it happened. One day I blurted out some dumb remark, and Sister Lurana was on me like a panther.

Rockefeller Sr., John D. Rockefeller Jr., Nelson A. Rockefeller, and their families-stands majestically atop a hill overlooking the Hudson River. Built between 1906 and 1913 by architects Delano and Aldrich, it has just recently been opened to the public. But visitors will never see the estate in as intimate a way as it is presented in this volume. To preserve the memory of what Kykuit was like when it was a private home, photographer Mary Louise Pierson, granddaughter of Nelson Rockefeller, spent years photographing the estate: the Big House-as family members call the main residence-and its interiors, designed by the renowned Ogden Codman; the outbuildings, including the Coach Barn, which now houses an impressive collection of horse-drawn carriages and an equally noteworthy collection of vintage cars, the orangerie, and the Playhouse, a Tudor-style mansion containing an indoor swimming pool, tennis court, fully equipped gym, and bowling alley; and the magnificent gardens, from the formal gardens designed by William Welles Bosworth to the golf course to the Japanese garden, and all the sculptures that three generations of Rockefellers installed on the grounds.<br> <br>The text, by Ann Rockefeller Roberts, Governor Rockefeller's daughter, recounts the history of the magnificent estate, from its founding early in the century through its recent transfer to the National Trust, focusing on how each successive generation left its stamp on the decor, the gardens, and the painting and sculpture collections. Illustrated with dozens of historical photos, ranging from the construction of the house to snapshots of family members, the text includes never before published reminiscences of five generations of Rockefellers.

Rockefeller (JDR) and John D. Rockefeller Jr. (Jr.) loved beautiful views and had an inherent sense of the land and its spirit, although they might never have expressed it in quite that way. The land they chose at Pocantico is a testament to this innate sensibility. Located on a wide sweep of the Hudson River known as the Tappan Zee, it was formed when ancient glaciers carved out a great rift and rounded the mountains into hills. These full, rolling hills stretch back from the river; morning mist drifts among them, storms bear down along the river with sudden speed and power, evenings can be still and sweet or brilliant with the riotous colors of the setting sun. Gazing at the uninterrupted vistas, one has a startling sense of how this land must have looked before the first European settlers arrived&#x2014;miles of deciduous and evergreen forest, the river a ribbon of undulating silver cutting through it.<br> <br>The character of the land is felt in the many elements that comprise it: the rock ledges that form a massive crust underneath, barely hidden in spots, rising up through the earth in others; the mantle of earth over the rock, deep and rich in many places, shallow in others, but always full of loose stones (used by early settles to form miles of walls, and reused by JDR and Jr. for house foundations, garden walls, and terraces); the wide variety of deciduous trees, including oak, elm, maple, butternut, walnut, and tulip; evergreens, such as pine, hemlock, and spruce; and myriad other native flora&#x2014;dogwood, laurel, azalea, wildflowers, mosses, grasses, shrubbery, vines. The wildlife of the area was also originally very rich and varied; now it consists of creatures that can coexist more easily with white-tailed deer with their large ears and bobbing tails, possums, raccoons, rabbits, mice, the occasional fox, hawks, owls, and a variety of songbirds, as well as the ubiquitous crow.<br> <br>On this natural matrix the built elements were laid out and a great, parklike estate was developed. The land became highly cultivated in every sense of the word, reflecting the character and spirit first of the father and son and then of succeeding generations.<br> <br>Each of the seasons etched in color, form, and texture all around Pocantico. In the early spring the melting snow reveals the browns and grays of the sleeping land, and the architectural forms of the gardens and buildings stand out starkly. Then a pale green haze of tender new shoots and leaves sweeps over the threes and manicured lawns. Before long spring bulbs, shrubbery, and flowering trees all burst into bloom in the gardens. In the summer it is a tapestry of leaf textures and shades of green, the gurgle of water in fountains, the dappled patterns of sunlight through leaves, the music of wind through the trees, the purring of lawn mowers over the greensward of the golf course. In the fall color manifests itself again in the riotous turning of the leaves, in swaths of chrysanthemums, and in the last roses in the gardens. Then winter sets in, stripping everything of its last hues, returning the earth to browns and grays, and finally cloaking everything in the white of snow or the silver of ice, glittering in the pale sun on statues, garden walls, and plants.<br> <br>The acquisition, development, and occupancy of Pocantico is intertwined with the lives of six generations of the Rockefeller family. It was intended to be&#x2014;and always remained&#x2014;a private home, the beloved country retreat of JDR and his wife, Laura Spelman Rockefeller, their children, and their children's children. The estate was developed between 1893, when JDR made the first purchase of land, and 1913, when the main house and its extensive gardens were largely completed. Since then there have been many more changes&#x2014;additional land was acquired, other buildings were built, and each succeeding generation left its distinctive touch.<br></p><h2>Batman: Zero Hour</h2><p>The Batman tales that tie into the epic &#x201c;Zero Hour&#x201d; storyline are now finally collected into one graphic novel in BATMAN: ZERO HOUR!&nbsp;<br><br> Time is collapsing in on itself.

Yet, with many of the cartoons collected here, the smug complacency lying beneath the air of irreverence gives the laughter a hollow ring. This omnibus includes the familiar names (Koren, Price, Arno, Day, Saxon, etc.) and reflects the all too familiar targetsworkaholics, keeping up with the Joneses, newscasters, the tug-of-war between spouses, shrewish wives, feminism, mild-mannered executives with Walter Mittyish fantasies, middle-class pretensions, cocktail parties and so forth. The cartoons' gentle or genteel humor is more likely to evoke a smile than a belly-laugh. Among the bright spots are Charles Addams's ghoulish fantasies which turn the macabre into an everyday occurrence, William Steig's delightfully wry musings and Saul Steinberg's metaphysical doodles.

Danny feels very lucky. He adores his life with his father, living in a gypsy caravan, listening to his stories, tending their gas station, puttering around the workshop, and occasionally taking off to fly home-built gas balloons and kites. His father has raised him on his own, ever since Danny's mother died when he was four months old. Life is peaceful and wonderful... until he turns 9 and discovers his father's one vice. Soon Danny finds himself the mastermind behind the most incredible plot ever attempted against nasty Victor Hazell, a wealthy landowner with a bad attitude. Can they pull it off? If so, Danny will truly be the champion of the world. <i>Danny</i> is right up to Roald Dahl's impishly brilliant standards. An intense and beautiful father-son relationship is balanced with sublegal high jinks that will have even the most rigid law-abider rooting them on. Dahl's inimitable way with words leaves the reader simultaneously satisfied and itching for more. (Ages 9 to 13) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>Danny&#39;s life seems perfect: his home is a gypsy caravan, he&#39;s the youngest car mechanic around, and his best friend is his dad, who never runs out of wonderful stories to tell.

Echo, rushing from the truck-stop restaurant with the remains of her supper in a take-out box, in hopes of not getting <i>too</i> wet before she reached her car, stopped cold.<p> </p><p>"I do not need a dog," she told the universe, tilting back her head and letting the drizzle wash away the last tired traces of her makeup.</p><p> </p><p>The dog whimpered. It was a large creature, of indeterminate color and breed. A slight indentation around its neck revealed that it had once worn a collar, and its ribs showed. One forepaw bore the brownish stain of old blood.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, hell," Echo said. She glanced around the parking lot, empty except for a few semitrucks and an ancient RV, but there was no one in sight, no one conveniently searching for a missing pet.</p><p> </p><p>The dog had obviously been on its own for days, if not weeks&#x2014;or even months.</p><p> </p><p>Just imagining the loneliness, fear and depriva-tion the poor thing must have experienced made Echo shudder and opened a gaping chasm of sympathy within her.</p><p> </p><p>The canine wayfarer had either been dropped off&#x2014;there was a special place in hell, in Echo's opinion, for people who abandoned helpless animals&#x2014;or it had gotten away somehow, while its owners were gassing up at the pumps or inside the restaurant having a meal.</p><p> </p><p>"I just had this car detailed," Echo told the dog. The bug was her only vanity, a reckless indulgence with psychological implications she didn't care to examine too closely.</p><p> </p><p>The animal whimpered again, and looked up at her with such sad hope in its soulful brown eyes that Echo's heart melted all over again.</p><p> </p><p>Resigned, she rounded the car and opened the passenger door with one hand, balancing the take-out box in the other. The dog slunk along with her, half crouched, limping a little.</p><p> </p><p>"Go ahead," she said gently. "Get in."</p><p> </p><p>The dog hesitated, then made the leap into the seat&#x2014;mud, rainwater and all.</p><p> </p><p>Echo sighed, opened the take-out box and stood in the rain, hand-feeding the animal the last of her meat loaf special. So much for staying within her travel budget by stretching every meal into at least two more.</p><p> </p><p>Ravenous, the poor critter gulped down its supper and looked up at Echo with such pathetic gratitude that tears came into her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"Don't worry," she said, to herself as much as the dog. "Everything's going to be okay."</p><p> </p><p>She closed the car door, let the rain wash her hands clean, holding them out palms up as if in supplication, and rubbed them semidry on her ancient tan Burberry coat before settling behind the wheel once more.</p><p> </p><p>The dog, dripping onto Echo's formerly clean leather seat, eyed her with weary adoration.</p><p> </p><p>Echo started the car, and the combination of wet dog and her own soggy raincoat instantly fogged up the windows.</p><p> </p><p>"This is Arizona," she complained to her new traveling companion. "It's supposed to be <i>dry.</i>"</p><p> </p><p>The dog sighed, as if to concur that nothing was as it should be.</p><p> </p><p>"You really <i>are</i> wet," Echo remarked matter-of-factly. She switched on the defroster, pulled the lever to open the trunk and braved the elements again to get out the quilt she'd carried around with her since childhood. After bundling the dog, she peeled off her raincoat and tossed it over the seat before getting back in the car and buckling up.</p><p> </p><p>Cocooned in faded colors, the dog sighed again, lay down as best it could given the disparity between its size and that of the seat, and was snoring by the time Echo pulled out onto Highway 10.</p><p> </p><p>Two and a half hours later, on the outskirts of Phoenix, she turned into the lot of a medium-priced chain hotel. The rain had stopped, and there was a muggy warmth in the night air.</p><p> </p><p>The dog sat up, yawning, the quilt falling away in damp folds.</p><p> </p><p>Echo assessed the creature again. "I was hoping to make it to Indian Rock tonight," she told her be-draggled passenger, "but I'm tired and, frankly, you stink. So I'm going to spring for a room, and we'll hit the road again in the morning. Wait here."</p><p> </p><p>The dog looked alarmed at the prospect of her de-parture, and made a low, whining sound in its throat.</p><p> </p><p>Echo patted its filthy head. "Not to worry, Muttzo," she said. "It's you and me until we find your people."</p><p> </p><p>Grabbing her hobo bag, she got out of the car slowly, leaving a window cracked, and headed for the main entrance, hoping she didn't smell like the dog.</p><p> </p><p>"Good news," she said when she returned after fifteen minutes, clutching a key card in hand.</p><p> </p><p>"We're in." The dog was so glad to see her that it leaned across and laved her face with its rough, meatloaf-scented tongue. "Of course, I <i>did</i> tell them you were a toy poodle."</p><p> </p><p>Echo drove around to the back and parked under a light. The dog politely paused to do its business in the shrubbery while Echo wrestled one of her suitcases out of the Volks. Inside, they slogged along a carpeted hallway to room 117 and entered.</p><p> </p><p>"You get the first bath," Echo told her canine friend, leading the way to the bathroom. As soon as she turned on the faucet in the tub, the dog leaped over the side and lapped thirstily at the flow.</p><p> </p><p>The showerhead was on a long metal tube, one of those detachable jobs, so Echo took it down from its hook and knelt beside the tub. Finished slurping, the dog sat down, watching her, its eyes luminous with trust.</p><p> </p><p>"What do you know?" Echo asked, after consid-erable spraying. Ten pounds of dirt rolled down to the bottom of the tub and swirled around the drain.</p><p> </p><p>"You're a white Lab. And female, too."</p><p> </p><p>The dog gazed at her soulfully, enduring. One more trial in a long sequence of them.</p><p> </p><p>Echo opened a tiny packet of soap and lathered the dog's coat. Rinsed. Lathered again. The soap bar wore away to a nubbin, so she fetched a bottle of shampoo from her cosmetic bag.</p><p> </p><p>More lathering. More rinsing. "You need a name," Echo said as she towel-dried the dog. "Since there's something faintly mystical and Lady-of-the-Lakeish about you&#x2014;it's the eyes, I think&#x2014;" She paused, pondered and decided. "I hereby dub you Avalon."</p><p> </p><p>Avalon, apparently understanding that the bath was over, leaped out of the tub and stood uncertainly on the mat for a few moments, as though awaiting a cue. When Echo didn't issue any orders, the animal shook herself gloriously, dousing her human companion, and padded out into the main part of the hotel room.</p><p> </p><p>Echo laughed, found the blow-dryer and plugged it into a wall socket. Avalon's snow-white fur curled endearingly under the onslaught of heat. Once the dog was thoroughly dry, Echo filled the ice bucket with water, set it on the floor and dodged into the bathroom for a badly needed shower of her own.</p><p> </p><p>When she came out, bundled in a robe, with her curly, shoulder-length blond hair standing out around her head like an aureole, Avalon had curled up on the floor, at the foot of the bed. The dog opened one brown eye and lifted her head slightly, and there was a certain stalwart wariness in her manner now, as if she expected to be chased away.</p><p> </p><p>Echo's throat tightened. She knew what it was like to feel that way, to hover on the fringes of things, hoping not to be noticed and, at the same time, yearning desperately to belong.</p><p> </p><p>Her old life, in Chicago, had been all about waiting on the sidelines. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey," she said, crouching to stroke Avalon's soft, gleaming coat. "I'm a woman of my word. We'll stick together, as long as necessary. Share and share alike." She put out her hand and, to her surprise, Avalon placed a paw in her palm. They shook on the deal.</p><p> </p><p>After blow-drying her hair and winding it into a French braid to keep it from frizzing out, Echo pulled on a cotton nightshirt, brushed her teeth and climbed into bed, leaning to switch off the bedside lamp.</p><p> </p><p>Avalon gave a soft, pitiful whine, as though she were crying.</p><p> </p><p>Echo's eyes burned again. "Come on, then," she said. "There's room enough up here for both of us."</p><p> </p><p>Avalon jumped onto the bed, nested at Echo's feet and fell asleep.</p><p> </p><p>Echo, exhausted after days on the road, wasn't far behind.</p></p><h2>The Good Samaritan</h2><p><p><b>She&#x2019;s a friendly voice on the phone.

Beowulf&#39;s terrifying quest to destroy Grendel, the foul fiend, a hideous sea-hag and a monstrous fire-dragon is the oldest surviving epic in British literature. Artfully retold and magnificently illustrated, this companion volume to &#34;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&#34; is made instantly accessible to children by a formidable children&#39;s book partnership.</p><p>Michael Morpurgo, the 2003-2005 Children&#39;s Laureate, is widely recognized as a master storyteller, and has won numerous awards for his work, including the Smarties Book Prize, the Writer&#39;s Guild Award and the Children&#39;s Book Award (for The Wreck of the Zanzibar). Michael lives in Devon. Michael Foreman is one of the world&#39;s leading illustrators. He has won several major awards, including the Kate Greenaway Medal, most recently for War Boy. His titles for Walker Books include Beowulf (9781844287543), Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (9781844287307) and Mia&#39;s Story (9781844282784). He lives in London.Grade 7 Up&#x2013;Morpurgo retells the classic story of the courageous young warrior from the land of Geats (now southern Sweden) who used his brute strength to save the neighboring Danes, then his own kinsmen, by slaying two horrible monsters, a sea serpent, and a massive dragon. The tale has been divided into three segments: the story of the monster Grendel's defeat; the slaying of his mother, the sea-hag; and the battle with the death dragon of the deep. Morpurgo has retold the tale in twisting, long-winded sentences that call to mind the way in which old epics were recounted by poets and bards. The text-filled pages framed with a Celtic-style border are broken up with small watercolor illustrations tucked here and there to help move things along. Many attractive full-page watercolor and pastel paintings illustrate important action-filled scenes&#x2013;battles, a banquet, and Beowulf's funeral pyre. Morpurgo's short acknowledgment states that his inspiration for this version of the Old English classic came from the likes of Seamus Heaney, Rosemary Sutcliffe, and Kevin Crossley-Holland. The lack of introductory material and historical background is noticeable but overall this is a fine retelling.<i>&#x2013;Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, OH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This beautiful, authoritative work is an international survey of classic beer styles, innovative brewers, and tantalizing food accompaniments. 10 maps. 100 labels.</p><p>"Beer deserves to be treated as a civilized drink; it may even have been the cause of civilization." Jackson ( The New World Guide to Beer ) here presents a knowledgeable and civilized survey of the various and sundry beers imbibed around the globe. You'll learn, for example, that Ninkasi was a Sumerian goddess of brewing, and that malt-making may be as much as 4000 years old. He explains what fruit beers are ("A beer made with fruit sounds like a contradiction. Surely it is a wine?"), and defines lagers, ales, porters, wheat beers and more; discusses and rates the beers of assorted nations; and suggests what foods go well with which beers. Jackson is excellent at combining historical detail with current information about the beers and brewers in question; his organization is logical and accessible.

She quickly learns to love her new life with him. But her strict aunt decides that Heidi must be sent away again, to live in town. Heidi cannot bear being away from the mountains and is determined to return to the happiness of life with her grandfather.</p><p>Johanna Spyri's classic story of a young orphan sent to live with her grumpy grandfather in the Swiss Alps is retold in it's entirety in this beautifully bound hardcover edition. <i>Heidi</i> has charmed and intrigued readers since it's original publication in 1880. Much more than a children's story, the narrative is also a lesson on the precarious nature of freedom, a luxury too often taken for granted. Heidi almost loses her liberty as she is ripped away from the tranquility of the mountains to tend to a sick cousin in the city. Happily, all's well that ends well, and the reader is left with only warm, fuzzy thoughts.

Cahill, aided in his research by TV reporter Ewing, recreates Gacy's unhappy childhood with a violent father; his seemingly respectable life as a successful contractor and civic leader; and his five-year spree as a murderer who raped and tortured his victims. The book is told mainly from the vantage of the homosexual Gacy, a "creature of lies, internal contradictions, misrepresentations, and false idealism," who claims utter confusion over the crimes. Jurors dismissed an insanity plea, finding Gacy complex, antisocial and rational. Cahill includes graphic accounts of torture and sexual acts. Major ad/promo; first serial to Us magazine; author tour. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.John Gacy, sentenced to death for the Chicago-area slayings of 33 young men, has been the subject of prior bookssee, for example, Terry Sullivan's Killer Clown ( LJ 9/1/83). None, however, has explored the depths of Gacy's aberrant psychology, his childhood, and daily life as well as Buried Dreams. With Gacy's cooperation, albeit often contradictory and self-serving, and a four-year-long investigation, Cahill has managed the difficult task of unmasking, to the extent that it can be done, the motivation of a horrific killer.

Such a current is structuralism. Reacting against "modernist" alienation and fragmentation, it is an integrative and holistic way of looking at the world; it seeks reality not in individual things but in the relationships among them. Its aim, says Robert Scholes, is nothing less than the unification of all the sciences into a new system of belief. <br>The impact of structuralism on literature and literary study is the concern of this extraordinarily lucid book. Mr. Scholes explores the linguistic background of structuralism, its historical connections to romanticism and Russian formalism, and the theory and practice of the leading contemporary structuralist literary critics. <br>"In Scholes&#x2019;s book we have beautifully lucid, and at the same time intelligently critical, accounts of such areas of controversy as Jakobson and Riffaterre on Baudelaire&#x2019;s <i>Les Chats</i>; Jolles&#x2019;s <i>Simple Forms</i> and the drama speculations of Souriau; Propp on the folktale . . . and other Russian &#x2018;formalist&#x2019; critics; L�vi-Strauss on myth; Greimas, Bremond and Todorov on narrative structure and Barthes and Genette on analysis of the meaning-structure of a literary text. . . . Those already persuaded of the importance of the field will see this book as . . . perhaps the most valuable general work available."<br>-- <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i><br></p><p>Robert Scholes is Research Professor of Modern Culture and Media, Brown University.

A number of techniques are employed when applying colour to the fabric including batik, salt discharge and brushing dye into a wet surface. Beautiful pictures are then stitched and built up over the background in easy stages. The feeling of perspective is enhanced by the clever use of scale and colour, and all the techniques are explained clearly and demonstrated in a series of stunning projects. This original book is packed with practical advice and information. Anyone interested in pattern, texture and colour will discover a wealth of inspiration when they work through the projects. Gilda&#39;s highly individual designs will encourage beginners and more experienced embroiderers to create their own embroidered flower designs.</p><p><p>Gilda Baron, who sadly passed away in 2015, had a wonderful career as a well-respected textile artist. Trained at the London College of Fashion, she not only became a lecturer in fashion and crafts, she was also a regular contributor to magazines and frequently exhibited at galleries, where she also sold her work. She held many workshops for embroiderers' groups and guilds over the years, demonstrating her love of fabric and embroidery and sharing her enthusiasm with people everywhere.

As In�s makes her way to Chile, she begins a fiery romance with Pedro de Valdivia, war hero and field marshal to the famed Francisco Pizarro. Together the lovers will build the new city of Santiago, and they will wage war against the indigenous Chileans&#x2014;a bloody struggle that will change In�s and Valdivia forever, inexorably pulling each of them toward separate destinies.</p><p><em>In�s of My Soul</em> is a work of breathtaking scope that masterfully dramatizes the known events of In�s Su�rez's life, crafting them into a novel rich with the narrative brilliance and passion readers have come to expect from Isabel Allende.</p></p><p><p>Isabel Allende is the author of twelve works of fiction, including the <em>New York Times </em>bestsellers <em>Maya&#x2019;s Notebook, Island Beneath the Sea, In�s of My Soul, Daughter of Fortune</em>, and a novel that has become a world-renowned classic, T<em>he House of the Spirits</em>. Born in Peru and raised in Chile, she lives in California.</p>Isabel Allende has crafted a compelling saga that adds to her repertoire of master storytelling. Blair Brown's impeccable performance brings Allende's eloquent prose to life, expressing the innermost thoughts of In�s Suarez, who is dictating her memoir. In�s reflects on her incredible journey from Spain to the founding of Santiago in the 1540s. With Pedro Valdivia, the first gobernador of the kingdom, In�s witnesses the cruelty and barbarism of the Spanish conquistadors and the native Chileans. The atrocities and brutality of the conquest are not spared in the narration, and some descriptions are not for the fainthearted. Brown's pronunciations and accents provide authenticity to the production, but it is her talent that brings the listener into the heart of the story. The Spanish music at the beginning and close of each CD lends additional style. L.D.H.

As a young black man in the Chicago of the '30s, he has no way out of the walls of poverty and racism that surround him, and after he murders a young white woman in a moment of panic, these walls begin to close in. There is no help for him--not from his hapless family; not from liberal do-gooders or from his well-meaning yet naive friend Jan; certainly not from the police, prosecutors, or judges. Bigger is debased, aggressive, dangerous, and a violent criminal. As such, he has no claim upon our compassion or sympathy. And yet...<p> A more compelling story than <i>Native Son</i> has not been written in the 20th century by an American writer. That is not to say that Richard Wright created a novel free of flaws, but that he wrote the first novel that successfully told the most painful and unvarnished truth about American social and class relations. As Irving Howe asserted in 1963, "The day <i>Native Son</i> appeared, American culture was changed forever. It made impossible a repetition of the old lies [and] brought out into the open, as no one ever had before, the hatred, fear and violence that have crippled and may yet destroy our culture."</p><p> Other books had focused on the experience of growing up black in America--including Wright's own highly successful <i>Uncle Tom's Children</i>, a collection of five stories that focused on the victimization of blacks who transgressed the code of racial segregation. But they suffered from what he saw as a kind of lyrical idealism, setting up sympathetic black characters in oppressive situations and evoking the reader's pity. In <i>Native Son</i>, Wright was aiming at something more. In Bigger, he created a character so damaged by racism and poverty, with dreams so perverted, and with human sensibilities so eroded, that he has no claim on the reader's compassion: </p><blockquote>"I didn't want to kill," Bigger shouted. "But what I killed for, I am! It must've been pretty deep in me to make me kill! I must have felt it awful hard to murder.... What I killed for must've been good!" Bigger's voice was full of frenzied anguish. "It must have been good! When a man kills, it's for something... I didn't know I was really alive in this world until I felt things hard enough to kill for 'em. It's the truth..."</blockquote> Wright's genius was that, in preventing us from feeling pity for Bigger, he forced us to confront the hopelessness, misery, and injustice of the society that gave birth to him. <i>--Andrew Himes</i><p>Right from the start, Bigger Thomas had been headed for jail. It could have been for assault or petty larceny; by chance, it was for murder and rape. <em>Native Son</em> tells the story of this young black man caught in a downward spiral after he kills a young white woman in a brief moment of panic. Set in Chicago in the 1930s, Wright's powerful novel is an unsparing reflection on the poverty and feelings of hopelessness experienced by people in inner cities across the country and of what it means to be black in America.</p></p><h2>Barakamon, Vol. 11 (Barakamon, 11)</h2><p>Damn it!!

From dust jacket notes: &#34;In the winter of 1915-1916, Kut el Amarah, a primitive and filthy village on the banks of the Tigris in northern Mesopotamia, became the scene of the most futile and humiliating disaster suffered by a British force between the disaster at Balaklava in 1854 and the capture of Singapore in 1942. It was here that Major General Sir Charles Townshend made the fatal decision to hold out with his division of ten thousand combat troops against a superior besieging force of Turks and Arab conscripts after he had been turned back in the drive to take Baghdad. The Siege of Kut lasted one hundred and forty-seven days - an epic of endurance, starvation, and disease - until Townshend was finally forced to surrender. Of the emaciated survivors forced to march into captivity twelve hundred miles across the broiling desert and freezing mountains, seventy per cent of the British and fifty per cent of the Indian troops perished: and that only after attempts to rescue the division had cost a Relief Force twenty-three thousand casualties. As for Townshend himself, he spent the rest of the war in luxurious house arrest on an island near Constantinople, enduring little worse than occasional boredom while he intrigued for his own release....&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Douay-Rheims &amp; Clementina Vulgata (English and Latin Edition)</h2><p>The Douay-Rheims Bible is one of the most beautiful and accurate Bibletranslations available with a word-for-word translation of theClementine Vulgate.

There, the positive-thinking artist/gadfly/aspiring entertainer crossed paths with everyone from Bob Dylan to Wilt Chamberlain. Then it was on to Woodstock and international (if fairly fleeting) fame. As befits an unapologetic counterculture adherent, Havens's memoir/life guide doesn't adhere to a tight structure. One minute he's offering a hasty guitar lesson, the next he's making passing reference to an encounter with the ghost of Aaron Burr at New York's Cafe Bizarre. He devotes as many words to unknown pals who've made a positive impression on him as he does to encounters with the Beatles and Elvis Presley. Some may find the fanciful flow of Havens's narrative disconcerting, but it's clearly the way the man has lived his life. It makes sense that he'd chronicle his experiences that way, too. <i>--Steven Stolder</i>Richie Havens has been performing and recording for more than thirty years.

But as Robert B. Reich makes clear in this eye-opening book, while supercapitalism is working wonderfully well to enlarge the economic pie, democracy&#x2014;charged with caring for <i>all</i> citizens&#x2014;is becoming less and less effective under its influence.<br><br>Reich explains how widening inequalities of income and wealth, heightened job insecurity, and the spreading effects of global warming are the logical outcomes of supercapitalism. He shows us why companies, fighting harder than ever to maintain their competitive positions, have become even more deeply involved in politics; and how average citizens, seeking great deals and invested in the stock market to an unprecedented degree, are increasingly loath to stand by their values if it means biting the hands that feed them. He makes clear how the tools traditionally used to temper America's societal problems&#x2014;fair taxation, well-funded public education, trade unions&#x2014;have withered as supercapitalism has burgeoned. <br><br>Reich sets out a clear course to a vibrant capitalism and a concurrent, equally vibrant democracy. He argues forcefully that the spheres of business and politics must be kept distinct. He calls for an end to the legal fiction that corporations are citizens, as well as the illusion that corporations can be "socially responsible" until laws define social needs. Reich explains why we must stop treating companies as if they were people&#x2014;and must therefore abolish the corporate income tax and levy it on shareholders instead, hold individuals rather than corporations guilty of criminal conduct, and not expect companies to be "patriotic." For, as Reich says, only people can be citizens, and only citizens should be allowed to participate in democratic decision making.</p><p>Robert B.

It combined a hugely productive economic system with a broadly responsive and widely admired political system. America in those years achieved its highest degree of income equality (since measurements have been available). It generated a larger proportion of good-paying jobs than before or since, and more economic security than ever for more of its people. Perhaps not coincidentally, in those years Americans also expressed high confidence in democracy and trust in government, both of which sharply declined in subsequent years.[1] That singular success and that powerful promise extended the moral authority of the American system throughout the world. In contrast to Soviet communism, America became an exemplar of both political freedom and suburban middle-class affluence.<br><br>The economy was based on mass production. Mass production was profitable because a large middle class had enough money to purchase what could be mass-produced. The middle class had the money because the profits from mass production were divided up between the giant corporations and their suppliers, retailers, and employees. The bargaining power of these latter groups was enhanced and enforced by government action. Almost a third of the workforce belonged to a labor union. Economic benefits were also spread across the nation&#x2014;to farmers, veterans, smaller towns, and small businesses&#x2014;through regulation (of railroads, telephones, utilities, and energy supplies) and subsidy (price supports, highways, federal loans). Thus did democracy offset the economic power of large-scale production and widely disperse its benefits.<br><br>But it was not quite a golden age. Women and minorities still struggled for political equality and economic opportunity. Much of the nation&#x2019;s poverty was hidden away in rural hollows or black ghettos. Foreign policy, ostensibly shaped by the perceived threat of Soviet communism, all too frequently pandered to the needs of large American firms for cheap raw materials abroad, such as bananas, tin, and oil. Civil liberties were imperiled during Senator Joe McCarthy&#x2019;s anti-communist witch hunt. Much of American life was monotonous, conformist, and deadly dull. And yet for all its shortcomings, democratic capitalism seemed to be working remarkably well, and on the way to working even better.<br><br>In order to understand what happened to the Not Quite Golden Age, we first need to understand how it came about.<br>The evolution began as the nineteenth century ended, when large corporations posed a profound challenge to American democracy. They brought a new level of prosperity to the nation but also sweatshops, child labor, and unsafe working conditions, and they monopolized whole industries. The unprecedented economic power of these giant companies made them politically unaccountable. America groped for a way to respond.<br><br>It started with outsized personalities whose footprints are still visible&#x2014;J. P. Morgan, a banker&#x2019;s son who sold stocks for the railroads, engineered a huge rail combination, and became a wealthy financier (J. P. Morgan and Sons, which evolved into today&#x2019;s Morgan Stanley); Andrew Carnegie, who began as a telephone clerk, rose to the presidency of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and then made a fortune as a steel magnate (Carnegie Steel); John D. Rockefeller, who started as a bookkeeper in Cleveland, bought his first oil refinery in 1862, cornered the oil market in the 1890s with his Standard Oil Company (whose descendant is ExxonMobil), and then moved into coal, iron, shipping, copper, and banking (Chase Manhattan); and, subsequently, Henry Ford.<br><br>With these men and others like them flowed a stream of new inventions&#x2014;steam engines, railway locomotives, the telegraph, electric turbines, internal combustion engines, and iron and steel machinery with interchangeable parts&#x2014;that allowed all sorts of things to be made and shipped in very large volume. Costs could be spread over so many units that each single one was cheap to produce. Procter &amp; Gamble devised a new machine for mass-producing Ivory soap. Diamond Match used a machine that made and boxed matches by the billions. A cigarette-making machine invented in 1881 was so productive that just fifteen of them satisfied America&#x2019;s annual demand for cigarettes. Standard Oil, American Sugar Refining, International Harvester, and Carnegie Steel, among others, gained unprecedented efficiencies through giant furnaces, whirling centrifuges, converters, and rolling and finishing equipment.<br><br>Productivity surged. While the typical American worker in the early 1800s had produced a tiny .3 percent more each year (seeding and harvesting crops, logging, fishing, or applying his craft with hand tools), by the last decades of the century his productivity was rising at six times that rate.[2] Output also exploded. Iron production doubled in just a few years; steel production multiplied twenty-fold.[3] Railroad and telegraph networks expanded in tandem. Fast, regular, and reliable transportation and communication brought raw materials from far corners of the country into factories and sent finished goods out to wholesalers and retailers all over the nation.<br><br>An economic revolution on this scale inevitably had large social consequence. Supply outran demand, leading to a severe depression that jolted much of Europe and America in 1873. Another depression in the summer of 1893 impoverished thousands of farmers, closed banks, and left more than a quarter of America&#x2019;s unskilled urban workforce unemployed. A growing chorus of socialists in Europe and America proclaimed the imminent collapse of capitalism. A swelling cadre of western populists in deepening debt to eastern bankers demanded that currencies be converted from gold to silver. With silver far more abundant than gold, this would inflate currency values and thereby shrink the debts. Manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic wanted higher tariffs to protect themselves from foreign imports. (Only Britain, whose advanced manufacturers were the primary beneficiaries of free trade, declined to raise its tariffs, resulting in what were seen there as German and American &#x201c;economic invasions.&#x201d;)[4]<br><br>Hundreds of thousands of people moved from farms to factories. In 1870, fewer than 8 percent of America&#x2019;s adult population worked in a mill and only one in five lived in a place with 8,000 or more inhabitants; a half century later, almost a third were in factories and almost a half lived in cities. During this tumultuous span of time, New York City&#x2019;s population swelled fourfold; Chicago became ten times its former size. In the 1870s, 280,000 immigrants entered the United States each year. In the 1880s, 5.5 million came; in the 1890s, another 4 million. By the first decade of the twentieth century, the flow of immigrants, most of them destitute when they arrived, rose to a million a year. According to a 1908 government study, almost three-fifths of the wage earners in principal branches of American industry had been born abroad.[5] Immigrants then constituted a higher percentage of the total American workforce than they would a hundred years hence.<br><br>As America and every other manufacturing nation began scouring more backward regions of the globe for potential markets, the term &#x201c;imperialism&#x201d; entered common speech. Teddy Roosevelt asserted America&#x2019;s imperial destiny in Latin America.&#x201c;Territorial expansion,&#x201d; explained an official of the United States State Department in 1900, &#x201c;is but the by-product of the expansion of commerce.&#x201d;[6] Britain and Germany equated their economic prowess with their nations&#x2019; global spheres of influence. The British economist J. A. Hobson dourly predicted the logical end-point of such competition: Businessmen, he warned, opt for war when they have exhausted their home markets. Like John Maynard Keynes three decades later, Hobson urged instead that advanced nations increase their domestic markets by making more of their citizens rich enough to buy domestically produced goods. &#x201c;If apportionment of incomes were such as to evoke no excessive saving, full constant employment for capital and labor would be furnished at home.&#x201d;[7] But the world war Hobson feared would occur before enough citizens had the wherewithal to buy a substantial portion of what they produced.<br><br>In the first decades of the twentieth century, productivity again surged. Sweatshops and mills were replaced by large manufacturing plants, inspired by Frederick Winslow Taylor&#x2019;s new theories of &#x201c;scientific management,&#x201d; which broke down every factory job into highly specialized and repetitive steps. Henry Ford&#x2019;s assembly line became the model. Not only could workers positioned along the line produce more cars in a shorter time but production could be concentrated in a few giant factories and materials could be bought in bulk at great savings. In 1909, Ford produced 10,607 cars; in 1913, 168,000; the following year, 248,000. By the beginning of World War I, much of American industry had consolidated into giant firms whose names became almost synonymous with America&#x2014;Ford Motor, U.S. Steel, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, United States Rubber, National Biscuit, American Can, the Aluminum Company of America, General Electric, General Motors, and Rockefeller&#x2019;s Standard Oil.<br><br>The size of such enterprises became an almost impregnable barrier to entry. They dominated the American, and much of the world&#x2019;s, economy for most of the twentieth century. Of the Fortune 500 largest corporations in 1994, more than half were founded between 1880 and 1930.[8] A far smaller portion was founded during the long stable period between 1945 and 1975, an important fact to bear in mind as the story unfolds.<br><b>Notes</b><br>[1] The most useful polling series of American attitudes toward government is <i>T...</i></p><h2>Trouble on Planet Earth (Choose Your Own Adventure #11)</h2><p><b>Trouble on Planet Earth</b> by R.

By the Christy Award-winning author of Hidden Places. Simultaneous.</p><p>&#34;Thank goodness you&#39;re such a plain child. You&#39;ll have to rely on your wits.&#34; So went the words of Grandma Bebe. And for all of my growing-up years, I scoffed at the beauty of my sister and what I saw as her meaningless existence. But my wits hadn&#39;t served me well in this instance, for here I was, in jail. And while I could have seen it as carrying on the family tradition (for Grandma Bebe landed in jail for her support of Prohibition), the truth is, my reasons for being here would probably break her heart. So how did I end up becoming a criminal? I&#39;ve been pondering that question all night. Perhaps the best way to search for an answer is to start at the very beginning....Languishing in jail, Harriet Sherwood sifts through the memories of three generations of women who have preceded her. In stories both courageous and heartbreaking, a heritage grounded by deep faith in the God of justice and righteousness emerges. And if Harriet has her way, she intends to set her life on a path just as remarkable and meaningful as theirs....</p><h2>The Oxygen Revolution: Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy: The New Treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury, Stroke, Autism and More</h2><p><b>HOPE FOR MANY &#x201c;HOPELESS&#x201d; DISEASES, FROM ONE OF THE FOREMOST RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD</b><br>&nbsp;<br>When Randy McCloy, Jr., the sole survivor of the Sago Mine disaster, finally walked out of the hospital to rejoin his family, it was in part due to the miracle of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is based on an almost laughably simple idea: Oxygen can be used therapeutically for a wide range of conditions where tissues have been damaged by oxygen deprivation. Restore that oxygen, goes the logical thinking, and you can restore much of the lost function.<br>&nbsp;<br>It seems too good to be true, but Dr. Paul G. Harch&#x2019;s research and clinical practice has shown that this noninvasive and painless treatment can help the tens of millions of Americans who suffer from a brain injury or disease, such as:<br>&nbsp;<br>� Stroke<br>� Autism and other learning disabilities<br>� Cerebral palsy and other birth injuries<br>� Alzheimer&#x2019;s, Parkinson&#x2019;s, multiple sclerosis, and other degenerative neurological diseases<br>� Emergency situations requiring resuscitation, such as cardiac arrest, carbon monoxide poisoning, or near drowning<br><br>It can also improve conditions in which inflammation is the culprit, such as arthritis and asthma; promote healing in infections, burns, and skin grafts, such as diabetic foot wounds; and slow the aging process.<br>&nbsp;<br>For the millions of Americans suffering from these seemingly &#x201c;hopeless&#x201d; diseases, here finally is the handbook of hope.

For the past five years, the lobster population along the coast of Maine has boomed, resulting in a lobster harvest six times the size of the record catch from the 1980s&#x2015;an event unheard of in fisheries. In a detective story, scientists and fishermen explore various theories for the glut. Leading contenders are a sudden lack of predators and a recent wedge of warming waters, which may disrupt the reproductive cycle, a consequence of climate change.</p><p>Christopher White's<i> The Last Lobster </i>follows three lobster captains&#x2015;Frank, Jason, and Julie (one the few female skippers in Maine)&#x2015;as they haul and set thousands of traps. Unexpectedly, boom may turn to bust, as the captains must fight a warming ocean, volatile prices, and rough weather to keep their livelihood afloat. The three captains work longer hours, trying to make up in volume what they lack in price. As a result, there are 3 million lobster traps on the bottom of the Gulf of Maine, while Frank, Jason, and others call for a reduction of traps. This may in boost prices. The Maine lobstering towns are among the first American communities to confront global warming, and the survival of the Maine Coast depends upon their efforts.</p><p>It may be an uphill battle to create a sustainable catch as high temperatures are already displacing lobsters northward toward Canadian waters&#x2015;out of reach of American fishermen. The last lobster may be just ahead.</p></p><p>Christopher White has written numerous books, including <i>Skipjack: The Story of America&#x2019;s Last Sailing Oystermen </i>and <i>The Melting World: A Journey Across America&#x2019;s Vanishing Glaciers</i>. His articles have appeared in <i>Audubon</i>, <i>The Baltimore Sun</i>, <i>The New Mexican</i>, <i>National Geographic</i>, and <i>Exploration</i>. He grew up on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay.<p>&#x201c;Christopher White has beautifully captured both a unique part of the world and a very special slice of Americana, the men and women who people the Maine lobster industry and the remarkable place they call home. With his words he evokes the smell of spruce trees and ocean brine, the sweet flavor of lobsters (and other gifts of the sea), the salty dialect of fishermen and women, and the enchantingly beautiful world they inhabit as they struggle to protect what is theirs.&#x201d; &#x2015;Nancy Harmon Jenkins, author of <i>Virgin Territory: Exploring the Worlds of Olive Oil</i> and <i>The New Mediterranean Diet Cookbook</i></p><p>&#x201c;Long Island, where I live, is a few hundred miles south of Maine, where this book is set. My best Long Island friend was for 25 years a lobsterman. A few years after his catches boomed, our waters got too warm for lobsters. Now he&#x2019;s a nurse in a hospital. No one recorded what happened here; no one saw it coming. Chris White sees these historic changes advancing up the coast, and has hurried to Maine to get it all down as people of the sea are caught in the vortex of change. If a book about warming waters can be chilling&#x2015;this one is. It is deeply human, tinged with the tragic shadowing of inevitable changes happening in real-time to people and their sea.&#x201d; &#x2015; Carl Safina, author of <i>Song for the Blue Ocean,</i> and <i>Beyond Words</i></p><p>"Just as in <i>Skipjack</i>, where Christopher White wrote so lyrically about water and the men and women who work on it, this is a beautiful and important story, one testifying not only to the remarkable skills and well-earned apprehensions of Maine lobstermen, but to the soul-filling beauty of their world." &#x2015;Richard Adams Carey, author of <i>Against the Tide: The Fate of New England Fishermen</i> and <i>Philosopher Fish: Sturgeon, Caviar, and the Geography of Desire</i>.</p><p>Christopher White weaves an intimate and revealing portrait of the Maine lobster fishery as it wrestles with the uncertain consequences of a changing climate that surely will force a reckoning by all who make their living in the Gulf of Maine. From the early morning dock, out to sea and back, through the marketing chain and onto dinner plates from Maine to China &#x2013;<i> The Last Lobster</i> is a fascinating and insightful glimpse into one of the most important and threatened fisheries in the United States. &#x2015;Priscilla M. Brooks, Vice President and Director of Ocean Conservation, Conservation Law Foundation</p><p>"In this illuminating volume, White sets out to capture the look and feel of traditional Maine lobster villages [...] White conveys the significance of lobsters to people all over the world in this enjoyable sojourn with the lobster folk."&#x2015;<i>Publisher's Weekly</i></p><p>"An in-depth look at the state&#x2019;s most significant fishery [...] Lobsters are intrinsically linked to the soul of Maine, and White&#x2019;s thoughtful chronicle gives both the highly desired marine crustaceans and the people who seek them their due."&#x2015;<i>Booklist</i> </p><p>"A fascinating and personal study that also provides important ecological and environmental information. For readers who enjoy learning about fisheries and the ecology of the sea."&#x2015;<i>Library Journal </i></p><br><p>Praise for Christopher White's <i>Skipjack</i>:</p><p>&#x201c;[An] evocative portrait of the nation's most beautiful and poignant vocational anachronism. It's an action-packed tale, complete with waterborne grudge matches, on-deck shootouts, fierce winter storms and suspenseful escapes. To his great credit, White resists any temptation to romanticize his skipjackers as quaint rustics simply overtaken by a modern world.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;Christopher White's <i>Skipjack</i> is not only a powerful elegy for a great American fishery, it's an act of defiance against all that has conspired to empty the dredges of these beautiful boats. White's prose is like the oystermen he portrays: tough, lyrical, and soaked to the bone in the waters of Chesapeake Bay. I've still got a lump in my throat from its last page.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Richard Adams Carey, Against the Tide: The Fate of New England Fishermen and the Philosopher Fish</i></p><p>&#x201c;Christopher White's Skipjack, which chronicles the Chesapeake life history and impending death of our nation's last fishery under sail, is a colorful, comprehensive, and valuable piece of Americana&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Peter Matthiessen</i></p><p>&#x201c;The world has almost run out of fish, as modern technology strips our oceans bare. Christopher White's Skipjack is a compelling story about how the wisdom of the past can help us protect the future of our fisheries. If you savor seafood, White's chronicle of the gritty life aboard America's last sailboat fishing fleet is a tale you need to hear.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Trevor Corson, The Secret Life of Lobsters and The Zen of Fish: The Story of Sushi</i></p><p>&#x201c;Men who take their livings from the sea have their own language to reinforce kinship and keep strangers at bay. Only rarely is an outsider accepted into their inner circle, and then only when he knows how to listen and is willing to work. Even more rarely does such an adopted son capture the cadenced ebb and flow of watermen's speech. Herman Melville did it for New England whalers: Christopher White has now done it for the oystermen of Maryland's Eastern Shore. Just as Melville documented something greater than a whale hunt, White's account helps us understand how much all our lives will be diminished when the last oyster drudger sailed in from the Chesapeake... Skipjack is a masterpiece.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>George Reiger, author of Wanderer on My Native Shore</i></p><p>&#x201c;Well written, and carefully researched ... . Chris White's brilliant use of the waterman's vernacular and his intimate knowledge of multiple generations of watermen combine to make this an excellent treatise on a culture that is clearly disappearing.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Gilbert M. Grosvenor, former editor and Chairman of National Geographic Society</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>Praise for Christopher White's <i>The Melting World</i>:<br>"[A] moving story emerges. It's a fascinating outdoor adventure, an illuminating look into the science of a melting mountain--a fresh warning that the warming world is already here." <i>&#x2015;New York Times Book Review</i></p></p><h2>Cemetery John: The Undiscovered Mastermind Behind the Lindbergh Kidnapping</h2><p>Evidence, opinion, and logic have discredited the notion that Bruno Richard Hauptmann --electrocuted in 1936 --acted alone. In this meticulous and authoritative account of the crime, the trial, and the times of the Lindbergh kidnapping, Robert Zorn clears away decades of ungrounded speculation surrounding the case. Inspired by his father&#39;s relationship with the actual accomplices --including the mastermind --he presents the clearest ever picture of a criminal partnership, which would shake every class and culture of American society. Using personal possessions and documents, never-before seen photographs, new forensic evidence, and extensive research, Robert Zorn has written a shocking and captivating account of the crime and the original &#34;Trial of the Century.&#34; From the ecstatic riots that followed the Spirit of St. Louis on either side of the Atlantic, to the tragic night that would shake America&#39;s sense of security, to the horror of the New Jersey morgue where Lindbergh insisted on verifying the identity of his son, Zorn&#39;s skillful treatment meets this larger-than-life story and gives it definitive shape --revealing the true story behind the crime, for the first time.</p><p>Robert Zorn is a graduate of Duke University and the Wharton School of Business. His unique qualification to tell this story is his relationship to his father, the late Eugene C. Zorn, Jr., a nationally respected economist, and the only person who ever witnessed the conspiracy behind the kidnapping."Retelling the by now familiar story of Charlie Lindbergh's kidnapping, Zorn imbues it with novelistic suspense. Even if Zorn doesn't definitively prove that Knoll, who died in 1980, was the crime's mastermind and Hauptmann's accomplice, he makes a strong case."---"Publishers Weekly"<br><br>"An interesting read for Lindbergh fans."<br><br>"An interesting read for Lindbergh fans."---"Library Journal"<br>"Mr. Zorn embeds his theory in a deft narrative that borrows gracefully and with credit from many previous books about the Lindberghs and the kidnapping"--"The Wall Street Journal"<br><br>"Robert Zorn's account of his own investigation into this 80-year-old mystery is as compelling and dramatic as the crime itself. The term 'page turner' is used too frequently, but "Cemetery John" is just that. Once you start reading it, you will not stop. This book should be on the top of everyone's summer reading list. You won't be disappointed."---"The Daily Caller"</p><h2>Science in Traditional China</h2><p>The world&#x2019;s preeminent authority on Chinese science explores the philosophy, social structure, arts, crafts, and even military strategies that form our understanding of Chinese science, making instructive comparisons along the way to similar elements of Indian, Hellenistic, and Arabic cultures. A major portion of the book concentrates on Taoist alchemy that led not only to the invention of gunpowder and firearms, but also, through the search for macrobiotic life-elixirs, to the rise of modern medical chemistry.</p><p>&#x201c;Freewheeling, amusing, constantly alert and rarely dogmatic...

The author lyrically evokes his privileged childhood on an Adirondack estate, a colorful uncle who was a pioneer aviator and fighter ace, and his first explorations of the larger world he encountered as he came of age in the tumultuous 1960s. But above all this is a story of a father and his only son and of the unexpected peace finally made between them.</p><p>"An exquisite memoir of a boy growing up: of a world of privilege and the one beyond. It is in coming to under- stand his powerful father that Adam Hochschild is able to under- stand both worlds." --Studs Terkel <p>"I loved reading <i>Half the Way Home</i>. It is such a gentle book, its eloquence so delicate--and at the same time very strong, dealing as it does with such an exceptionally, intensely difficult relationship." --Alice Adams </p><p>"His story is fascinating, and the portrait of a lost childhood offered here evokes one of the archetypal dreams of the American mind." --E. L. Doctorow </p><p>"I was so moved, disturbed and diverted by this beautifully plain account of the most complicated and delicate set of emotions, not just between father and son but more widely between the mystery of power and powerlessness." --Nadine Gordimer</p>Adam Hochschild was born in New York City in 1942. His first book, Half the Way Home: a Memoir of Father and Son, was published in 1986. Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times called it "an extraordinarily moving portrait of the complexities and confusions of familial love . . . firmly grounded in the specifics of a particular time and place, conjuring them up with Proustian detail and affection." It was followed by The Mirror at Midnight: a South African Journey, and The Unquiet Ghost: Russians Remember Stalin. His 1997 collection, Finding the Trapdoor: Essays, Portraits, Travels, won the PEN/Spielvogel-Diamonstein Award for the Art of the Essay. King Leopold's Ghost: a Story of Greed, Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa was a finalist for the 1998 National Book Critics Circle Award. It also won a J.

But how do you do that? There are countless leadership books, but how many will actually help a Taco Bell shift manager, a Fortune 500 CEO, a new entrepreneur, or anyone in between?<p>Over his fifteen years at Yum! Brands, Novak has developed a trademarked program he calls Taking People with You. He spends several weeks each year personally teaching it to thousands of managers around the world. He convinces them that they'll never make big things happen until they learn how to get people on their side. No skill in business is more important. And Yum!'s extraordinary success (at least 13 percent growth for each of the last nine years) proves his point.</p><p>Novak knows that managers don't need leadership platitudes or business school theories. So he cuts right to the chase with a step-by- step guide to setting big goals, getting people to work together, blowing past your targets, and celebrating after you shock the skeptics. And then doing it again and again until consistent excellence becomes a core element of your culture.</p><p>This book has specific tools at the end of each chapter that will challenge you to reflect on how you're really doing on key aspects of leadership. And if you apply it, you'll immediately start to improve.</p><p>You'll learn how to . . . <br>� Get inside the heads of your people. You can't convince them of anything until you see the world from their perspective. <br>� Think big. If your sales growth last year was 3.5 percent, don't aim for 4 percent this year, aim for 15 percent. Even if you fail, you'll probably do better than you would have with a smaller goal. <br>� Practice "extraordinary authenticity." Show occasional vulnerability and admit when you don't have the answers. <br>� Look for good ideas in unexpected places. Novak's team came up with Cool Ranch Doritos for Frito-Lay during a field trip to a grocery store's salad dressing aisle. <br>� Choose a can-do mind-set. There's a huge difference between a boss who says "We can try this" and one who says "We can do this!" <br>� Cheer for first downs, not just touchdowns. Publicly recognizing and rewarding small wins keeps everyone motivated for the long haul. <br>� Get rid of cynics. In many teams one person will reject your values and spread negative energy. Moving that person out will show everyone else you're serious.</p><p>Get ready to change the way you think about leadership-and more important, the way you practice it every day.</p></p><p><b>David Novak</b> is the chairman and CEO of Yum!

You can go only so far by going it alone. If you want to start a business, if you want a big promotion, if you are developing or launching a new product, if you want your company to move in a new direction, if you want to expand your sales territory, if you want to raise money for a good cause, even if you become the coach of your child&#x2019;s soccer team, which has lost every game so far, and you want to show those kids what it feels like to win, you&#x2019;re going to need people to help you get there. You&#x2019;ll never accomplish anything big if you try to do it alone.</p><p>Early in my career, I had an experience that changed how I thought about my own role as a leader and inspired me to accomplish what, for me, is my greatest example of taking people with you. I was working for PepsiCo at the time, making my way up through the ranks, and had recently become head of operations for Pepsi Bottling. I had held mainly marketing positions until then, so operations was a new world for me. One of the first things I did was travel to our various plants to meet with the people there and find out more about how things worked.</p><p>I was at a plant in St. Louis, conducting a 6:00 A.M. roundtable meeting with a group of route salesmen, when, over coffee and doughnuts, I asked what I thought was a pretty straightforward question about merchandising, which is all about the displays and visibility we get in convenience and grocery stores. I wanted to know what they thought was working and what wasn&#x2019;t. Right away, someone piped up, &#x201c;Bob is the expert in that area. He can tell you how it&#x2019;s done.&#x201d; Someone else added, &#x201c;Bob taught me more in one day than I&#x2019;d learned in two years on the job.&#x201d; Every single person in the room agreed: Bob was the best there was. I looked over at Bob, thinking he must be thrilled by all this praise. Instead, I saw that he had tears running down his face. When I asked him what was wrong, Bob, who had been with the company for over forty years and was about to retire in just two weeks, said, &#x201c;I never knew anyone felt this way about me.&#x201d;</p><p>The rest of my visit to the plant went pretty well, but I walked away that day with an uneasy feeling. It was such a shame that Bob had never felt appreciated. It was a missed opportunity for the business, too. We all could have benefited from his expertise, and more people could have learned from him. This guy was clearly great at what he did, but who knows how much better he could have been in a workplace that recognized and rewarded his knowledge. I knew that if he felt overlooked and underappreciated, others at the plant did too.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve always believed in people, but that experience made me even more determined to be the kind of leader who would never let a person like Bob go through his entire career without being thanked for what he did and encouraged to find out how much more he could do. I wanted the people who worked for me to know that they mattered, and I wanted them to enjoy coming to work every day. I also understood that none of this would happen unless I made it happen. It was my job to cast the right shadow of leadership, because no one else was going to live up to these principles unless I lived up to them first. As a leader, you always have to remember that people tend to follow the leader&#x2019;s actions. You can&#x2019;t say one thing and then do another and expect people to believe in you or follow you. As the leader, you have the opportunity to set an example of how the business should be run.</p><p>I am now chairman and CEO of Yum! Brands, the world&#x2019;s largest restaurant company and owner of the brands KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. When I started in this position over a decade ago, I thought of the Bobs of the world and made it one of my first priorities to create a recognition culture in which everyone counted and to do it so successfully that our company would become renowned for it. That was no small task, considering we now have more than 1.4 million employees spread out over 117 countries around the world. But while we&#x2019;re far from perfect, it&#x2019;s working. I know it&#x2019;s working, because I get proof of it practically every day.</p><p>Today I am probably best known within my organization for casting a shadow of recognition and positive energy. I do this demonstrably by: (1) recognizing people in a unique way for their performance and (2) leading people in our Yum! cheer every chance I get. These two aspects of our culture have traveled all the way around the world. When I first started giving out recognition awards, I decided I wanted them to be much more memorable than your typical plaque or a pen. So when I was at KFC, for example, I gave out these floppy rubber chickens. In my current position, I give out a huge set of smiling teeth mounted on a pair of skinny legs with big feet. Now everywhere we do business, leaders in our organization give out their own versions of these awards. Our HR director in India recognizes outstanding performers by giving them a replica of the Taj Mahal, because the workers who built it are remembered for their passion, determination, and overall excellence. A general manager in Dubai gives out his Camel Award, because camels are revered animals in the desert, known for their steadfastness, perseverance, and undying spirit. The head of our construction department recognizes people with his Shovel Award, naturally, and our chief financial officer has his Show Me the Money Award, which consists of a transparent piggy bank filled with Monopoly money and a copy of the movie <i>Jerry McGuire,</i> in which that famous phrase originated. The fact that each leader took the time to personalize these awards makes recognition that much more meaningful and fun for everyone.</p><p>I&#x2019;d also venture to say that most of our 1.4 million people around the world now know and do the Yum! cheer, spelling out the name of our organization: &#x201c;Give me a Y,&#x201d; the leader will say, and team members will shout back &#x201c;Y!&#x201d; and so on. When I first started doing things like these, I was told by some people that my &#x201c;Western ideas&#x201d; wouldn&#x2019;t work in places like Asia or Europe. Boy, were those people wrong. I believe that, just like Bob, all people, no matter what they do or where they&#x2019;re from, want to know that they are important and to have fun while they&#x2019;re doing their job. My favorite picture, which now hangs prominently on the walls of our headquarters, features two thousand restaurant general managers proudly doing the Yum! cheer on the Great Wall of China, all of their hands held up high to create the &#x201c;Y&#x201d; in Yum! It always reminds me that my shadow has traveled a long way. It also reminds me of the power of taking people with you and the fact that it&#x2019;s the key to achieving breakthrough results. My goal for this book is to share with you everything I&#x2019;ve learned about how to lead your team so you can do just that.</p><p><i>Taking People with You</i> is not just another book filled with leadership principles you&#x2019;ve heard time and time again. It&#x2019;s really more of an action plan. It offers a very specific process that will help you maximize your potential as a leader and show you how to use your leadership skills to achieve the most important goals you can imagine. It&#x2019;s a book that will force you to look in the mirror and challenge yourself to rise to a higher level. It&#x2019;s a step by step guidebook and workbook, and by its end, you&#x2019;ll walk away with a tangible plan that you can use over and over again to get big things done. This is a book that will help you become not just a better leader, but also a better person, by making you more �self-�aware and showing you how to build up the people around you.</p><p>How can I make such bold promises? I&#x2019;m certain this book can do these things because I have been developing and testing its content for the past fifteen years. This book comes out of a leadership program of the same name that I have taught to more than four thousand people in my organization.</p><p>It all started back in 1996, when I was working for PepsiCo as the president of KFC and Pizza Hut. Roger Enrico, who was chairman of the company at the time, called me up and said, &#x201c;David, I&#x2019;d like you to create a leadership program for PepsiCo executives. You&#x2019;ve got a pretty good reputation for building and aligning teams, and I&#x2019;d like you to share what you know and what you do with others.&#x201d;</p><p>I was really honored and excited by the opportunity, because this is just the sort of thing I love to do. I went to work on the program right away. I had pretty much figured out what I was going to �present&#x2014;�I even had a date scheduled to give my very first program to a group of f...</p></p><h2>Girl in the Mirror</h2><p>Girl In The Mirror by Mary Alice Monroe released on Jun 24, 2004 is available now for purchase.</p><p>Mary Alice Monroe is a <em>New York Times</em> and <em>USA TODAY</em> bestselling author of thirteen novels.

It has inspired both attraction and fear, been perceived as beautiful and unclean, alluring and dangerous, a source of pleasure and nurturing but also a source of evil and destruction. </p><p> In <i>The Female Body in Western Culture</i>, twenty-three internationally noted scholars and critics, in specially commissioned essays, explore these representations and their consequences for contemporary art and culture. Ranging from Genesis to Gertrude Stein and Angela Carter, from ancient Greek ritual to the Victorian sleeping cure, from images of the Madonna to modern film and Surrealist art, the essays cover a wide spectrum of approaches and subject mailer. They all converge, however, around questions of power and powerlessness, voice and silence, subjecthood and objectification. And they point the way to the new possibilities and displacements of traditional male-female oppositions. Androgyny in a new key? This book demonstrates that a blurring of gender boundaries does not have to deny difference.</p></p><p><p>Susan Rubin Suleiman is the Dillon Professor of the Civilization of France and Professor of Comparative Literature, Harvard University.</p>I particularly loved the section about art: it goes way beyond earlier polemics about male artists and female models to explore the representational life of women's bodies.<br> --Nina Auerbach<br><br>From its opening essay on female eroticism by Susan Suleiman to its closing with Charles Bernheimer's brilliant study of the imagery of disgust in Huysmans, this is a fascinating, unsettling, and important book.

Yet even avid believers have difficulty conjuring up more than vague images of halos, harps, and wispy angels in flowing robes. Anthony DeStefano knew there had to be a more complete, meaningful, and comforting vision of what heaven is like, and A TRAVEL GUIDE TO HEAVEN is the entertaining and enlightening result.<br><br>Using the Bible as his guide, the author notes that heaven is not only a spiritual place, but also a physical place, a fabulous &#x201c;luxury resort&#x201d; more sumptuous than any on Earth. The residents are real, their bodies transformed into their most perfect selves&#x2014;physically, emotionally, and spiritually. By making a spiritual subject immensely physical, the book provides a picture of amazing places to visit, things to do, luxuries for pampering&#x2014;not to mention deep, abiding joy.<br><br>Combining the clarity and logic of C. S. Lewis with a terrific sense of fun and adventure, DeStefano creates a brilliant, reassuring portrait of heaven, a place that has intrigued and puzzled humankind throughout history. With its clear view of the afterlife, A TRAVEL GUIDE TO HEAVEN might best be compared to James Van Praagh's <i>Talking to Heaven</i> or Betty J. Eadie's <i>Embraced by the Light </i>in its tremendous message of comfort and reassurance.</p><p><b>Anthony DeStefano </b>has received may prestigious awards from religious organizations throughout the world for his efforts to advance Christian beliefs in modern culture. These include an honorary doctorate from the National Clergy Council and the Methodist Episcopal Church&#x2019;s Joint Academic Commission, as well as the &#x201c;Defender of Israel&#x201d; medal from the Jerusalem Center for Peace Studies, conferred on him in 2003. <br>He is the CEO of a Catholic not-for-profit organization; he lives in Long Island with his wife, Kimberly, a kindergarten teacher.CHAPTER 1<br><br>Welcome to Paradise!<br><br>When you ask people what they think heaven will be like, most struggle to find a clear answer. Instead of giving you a definite response, they usually grope for various adjectives. These almost always include words like cloudy, hazy, white, and dreamlike. Sometimes people will tell you they picture heaven as being infused with "incredibly intense light." Whatever you imagine heaven to be, chances are that one of the first words that comes to your mind is spiritual.<br><br>When we do allow ourselves to describe heaven in a material way, we usually think of angels or saints walking around wearing long white robes and choirs singing in the background. The only activity we imagine these strange beings engaging in is never-ending worship of some invisible God, who is as cloudy, nebulous, and undefined as heaven itself.<br><br>And then we wonder why no one is excited about traveling to this place!<br><br>Well, the first thing to do before we begin our trip is to get the picture of robes and choirs out of our minds altogether. Many of us have such a monumental misconception about heaven that it severely limits our capacity to imagine it, much less look forward to it. The reason is partly that the entertainment industry has programmed us to picture heaven in a very cartoonish way, with clouds, harps, halos, and the like. The real culprits, however, have been poets. Down through the ages, poets have attempted to capture the joy, rapture, and happiness of heaven by giving us an abundance of "ethereal" images. These images, while designed to elevate our souls and show us a glimpse of the transcendent nature of heaven, often have the opposite effect--they leave us flat, dry, and bored.<br><br>Now, I am not disparaging poets. They have merely tried to do to heaven what they do to everything else: reduce it to its elemental truth. But in this cynical, skeptical, practical age of ours, we don't necessarily want the elemental truth. We already know that heaven is "paradise" and that we're going to experience "ultimate joy" when we get there. What we desperately want to know is the specifics! We want to know how we're going to be so happy there.<br><br>Do you want to understand heaven better than you have in your entire life? Do you want to have a true experience of heaven, right this second? You can without reading another chapter. Simply try this experiment: Take the page you're reading and crinkle the corner. Now listen to the sound it makes. Then grab the chair you're sitting on with your hand and squeeze. Feel how hard it is. Then take a deep breath and let your lungs fill with air. Smell the odors of the room you're sitting in. Finally, look around and see all the various shapes and colors of the objects that are before you.<br><br>I'll tell you a secret: heaven is going to be like that. Heaven is physical.<br><br>Don't misunderstand me. That's not all heaven is. Heaven is radically, amazingly, incredibly different from the room you're sitting in. If it weren't, it would hardly be worth the trip. But we have to start with the basics. Before we discuss all the exciting and transcendent spiritual aspects of the place, we need to get straight, once and for all, this fundamental truth: Heaven is, at its core, not only spiritual, but material as well.<br><br>If the great monotheistic religions of the world--Judaism, Christianity, and Islam--have taught us anything at all, it's that God is a God of creation. He loves to make things. From the very beginning of the Bible to the very end, God has been busy creating all sorts of wonderful objects: galaxies, stars, planets, oceans, canyons, forests, animals, fish, human beings. You name it, he's created it. And he's always busy using those things to accomplish his will. Very rarely does he snap his fingers and make something appear out of thin air. He usually employs the help of one of his creations to bring about the change or effect he wants. In other words, he usually uses physical means to do the things he wants.<br><br>Now, do you really think God is going to abandon his love of creating and his love of the physical, just because this little world of ours comes to an end? Do you think that after all he's done throughout the course of history, he's going to make heaven some cloudy, hazy dreamland? Of course not. That's not the way he operates. Nor is it what the Bible or Christianity teaches.<br><br>While Christian theologians have certainly used poetic language to expound upon the spiritual aspects of heaven, for two millennia they have also insisted that heaven will have physical characteristics as well. Indeed, just like the exotic ports of call here on earth, heaven will have its own distinct climate, landscape, and population. Christ himself used very physical images to describe heaven. He said, for example, that in his Father's "house" there are many "mansions," and that he was going there to prepare a "place" for us. In the Book of Revelation, that point is driven home yet again. Even though the biblical description of heaven makes ample use of both literal and symbolic imagery--complete with streets made of gold, pillars made of pearls, and walls adorned with jewels--there can be no doubt that heaven is going to be very tangible. It will be a visible locality, made up of visible structures and materials, with real dimensions and distances.<br><br>For some reason, this truth hasn't resonated fully with most people. Yet, it is absolutely essential for all of us to grasp. In fact, if you get nothing else out of this book, understand this one fundamental Christian belief: while heaven is a spiritual reality, it is also very much a place. It is real and it is physical. In some mysterious way, we will be able to touch it, feel it, smell it, hear it, and see it. That means that the life we're going to lead there--despite its transcendent spiritual quality--is going to be much more like the life we're leading now than most of us have ever imagined.<br><br>But what about my uncle who passed away last year? What about my grandparents who died when I was little? What about all the good and holy people who have died in the whole history of the world? Are they experiencing heaven as a physical place right now?<br><br>The answer to these questions is: no, not yet. And before we go any further, it's important to explain why.<br><br>There are two fundamental ways of using the word heaven. When someone we love dies, we often say we hope that person has "gone to heaven." And of course that may be true. Heaven isn't just a place of the future. Heaven exists now. Heaven is the word we use to describe the place where God is at this very second. If our friends and relatives who died before us were judged by God as worthy to enter paradise, it's perfectly accurate to say that they are in heaven. As you are reading these very words, your grandmother, your father, your aunt, or anyone else you love who has died may be experiencing the incredible, ecstatic happiness of living with God. But while this is true in the deepest sense, it's also true--as Augustine, Aquinas, and all the great eschatological theologians have said--that they are not yet experiencing heaven to the fullest degree possible.<br><br>That's because human beings are comprised of both bodies and souls. When we die, the two are separated--temporarily. Christianity has always taught that on the day of the Last Judgment--at the end of the world--all those who have died will rise, in the same way that Christ did. At that moment, our bodies and souls will be joined again, never to be separated. Before that takes place, however, there will be a period of waiting--a period of time before we get our physical bodies back.<br><br>During this interim phase, it won't be possible for us to have all the pleasures of heaven. The reason, as we've noted, is that heaven, ultimately, will be physical as well as spiritual--and you need a physical body to fully enjoy a physical environment. You might say that heaven is like a five-star hotel. Just after we die, we can check into a beautiful suite and enjoy many amenities that will make our stay wonderful; but later on--when we're whole again--we'll be invited into the gorgeous penthouse, and be able to experience all the new and exciting sensory pleasures that the entire resort has to offer.<br><br>Unfortunately, we have to wait until the resurrection for that "reunion" of body and spirit to take place. How long will that wait be? Only God knows the answer. It may be a few centuries, it may be a few hours. Nor can we venture to guess what that wait will feel like to us. Once our souls are separated from our bodies, we will be outside of all time and space. If your mother died fifty years ago, there's no way of knowing if her soul has experienced the passage of time in the same way that you have. Who can say for sure if fifty years of "earth time" will feel like fifty years of "heaven time"? It may not. It may, in fact, seem much shorter. As St. Peter said, with God, "one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day."<br><br>And yet, there's no doubt that this interim period frightens a lot of people. In fact, it can be downright terrifying if all we imagine death to be is darkness and silence. What we sometimes forget is that we do have something to compare the experience to.<br><br>Everyone knows what it feels like to be separated from our bodies, because everyone knows what it feels like to dream. Think about this for a moment. When you are sound asleep in bed, your body motionless, you know that in your mind you can be a thousand miles away, sailing on a boat, floating through the air, laughing with your friends, having a perfectly wonderful time. Sometimes, just before you wake up, you may even realize you are dreaming. You may actually be aware that you are in bed and that what you are seeing in your mind's eye is part of a fantasy world.<br><br>Regardless of this knowledge, however, the colors you're seeing are just as vibrant, the sounds you're h...</p><h2>The Net and the Butterfly: The Art and Practice of Breakthrough Thinking</h2><p><b>In <i>The Charisma Myth</i>, Olivia Fox Cabane offered a groundbreaking approach to becoming more charismatic. Now she teams up with Judah Pollack to reveal how anyone can train their brain to have more eureka insights.<br><br></b>The creative mode in your brain is like a butterfly. It's beautiful and erratic, hard to catch and highly valued as a result. If you want to capture it, you need a net. Enter the executive mode, the task-oriented network in your brain that help you tie your shoes, run a meeting, or pitch a client. To succeed, you need both modes to work together--your inner butterfly to be active and free, but your inner net to be ready to spring at the right time and create that "aha!" moment. But is there any way to trigger these insights, beyond dumb luck?<br><br>Thanks to recent neuroscience discoveries, we can now explain these breakthrough moments--and also induce them through a series of specific practices. It turns out there's a hidden pattern to all these seemingly random breakthrough ideas. From Achimedes' iconic moment in the bathtub to designer Adam Cheyer's idea for Siri, accidental breakthroughs throughout history share a common origin story. In this book, you will learn to master the skills that will transform your brain into a consistent generator of insights.<br><br>Drawing on their extensive coaching and training practice with top Silicon Valley firms, Cabane and Pollack provide a step-by-step process for accessing the part of the brain that produces breakthroughs and systematically removing internal blocks. Their tactics range from simple to zany, such as:<br><br>� Imagine an alternate universe where gravity doesn&#x2019;t exist, and the social and legal rules that&nbsp;govern it.<br> � Map Disney&#x2019;s Pocahontas story onto James Cameron&#x2019;s <i>Avatar</i>.<br> � Rid yourself of imposter syndrome through mental exercises.<br> � Literally change your perspective by climbing a tree.<br> � Stimulate your butterfly mode by watching a foreign film without subtitles.<br><br>By trying the exercises in this book, readers will emerge with a powerful new capacity for breakthrough thinking.</p><p><b>Olivia Fox Cabane</b>&nbsp;is the former Director of Innovative Leadership for Stanford StartX and the bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Charisma Myth</i>.

A Hungarian newspaper editor who earned his salary by writing, he was frustrated with the tools of his trade. He seemed to spend his time either filling up his fountain pens, or then cleaning up the smudges they made.<br><br> Of course he was grateful for the invention of the fountain pen: it was a vast improvement over feather quills. But it still meant ink splotches and ruined pages that had to be written all over again.<br><br> Why couldn't the ink from his fountain be more like the ink used to print his newspaper? B&#x2019;r&#x2014; already knew the answer: newspaper ink was much too thick for his fountain pen. Right ink, wrong pen. Deciding to use the newspaper ink was a good idea. But it wasn't a breakthrough.<br><br> The breakthrough came with a new way to deliver the ink. Rather than trying to get the thick ink to flow through a nib, B&#x2019;r&#x2014; and his brother figured out how to set a metal ball in a socket and let the thick ink roll out from behind the ball.<br><br> Now let's be clear-ballpoint pens had been attempted before. They just hadn't worked until then. Early ballpoints did not deliver the ink evenly; overflow and clogging were just two of the many issues that made them impractical. The breakthrough came when B&#x2019;r&#x2014; made the ballpoint pen viable.<br><br> In business, a breakthrough is often described as an idea that solves a problem or satisfies a need in an entirely new way. Although there is no single definition of breakthroughs, we define them quite simply as the moment when you break through something that was previously limiting you, whether it's a specific problem you couldn't find a solution to, a situation you couldn't understand, or simply an old way of doing or seeing things.<br><br> Sociologist and author Martha Beck describes the experience of breakthrough as "a shift in your understanding of the world, because the lens through which you view the world has been suddenly, gloriously changed. And boy, do breakthroughs feel amazing." A breakthrough is a sudden advance in your knowledge or understanding that moves you past a barrier and makes you see things, understand things in a new way. Although all breakthroughs come from the same process in the brain, not all breakthroughs come in the same way.<br><br> There are two main kinds of breakthroughs: intentional and unintentional. You'll face some of the same obstacles with both, but these obstacles will play out in different ways. Fear, for instance, impedes both intentional and unintentional breakthroughs-but it rears its ugly head at different stages of the breakthrough experience. For intentional breakthroughs, fear interferes before the breakthrough, bringing up the possibility of failure.<br><br> Fear seeps in after unintentional breakthroughs, and it centers on the oncoming challenges of implementing a solution. For instance, you suddenly realize (breakthrough) that you need a divorce. Anxiety might arise as you foresee the unpleasantness that all too often accompanies the process (implementation) of divorcing.<br><br> Or perhaps you suddenly realize (breakthrough) you've fallen in love with a close friend. You could fear being rejected after making your new feelings known (implementation), or, confusingly, fear success and the life changes it would entail.<br><br> For unintentional breakthroughs, landing on a solution isn't the end goal: you need to act on it. As Beck says, "Having breakthroughs isn't the point. Living them is. Seeing in a new way is only the beginning." Fear is a powerful saboteur of this process.<br><br> Although all breakthroughs come from the same process in the brain, not all breakthroughs come in the same way. We have identified four different types: eureka breakthrough, metaphorical breakthrough, intuitive breakthrough, and paradigm breakthrough. Understanding the different kinds of breakthroughs will help you spot them so you don't miss a single one. It will also help you discover the style, or styles, that are most natural to you so you can learn to focus on the way that works best for you.<br><br> The key is to understand that no style of breakthrough is better or more productive than another. It is simply best to understand which style or styles come most naturally to you.<br><br> Eureka Breakthrough<br><br> Eureka translates from the Greek as "I've got it" or "That's it." In popular culture, it has come to describe the moment when someone experiences a sudden, unexpected realization.<br><br> Archimedes, the original "Eureka!" shouter, was a Greek mathematician and scientist living in ancient Sicily in the third century b.c. One day, he was asked by King Hero, ruler of the city-state, to determine whether a crown was made of real gold. Since gold had a known density, all he had to do was measure the density of the crown and see whether it matched up.<br><br> The first part of measuring density was easy: determine the crown's weight. But the second part required measuring the crown's exact volume. Now, measuring the volume of an object like a cube is simple. But how do you determine the volume of an object as irregularly shaped as a crown?<br><br> Archimedes puzzled on the problem until one day while taking a bath. As he stepped into the bathtub, he watched the water rise, displaced by his leg. He realized that, just as the water had risen to accommodate the new volume of his leg, it would rise in response to the volume of the crown. So he could submerge the crown and measure the amount of water displaced to know the crown's volume, and thus calculate its density. He cried "Eureka!" and jumped out of his bath and ran through the streets of Syracuse stark naked, shouting all the way.<br><br> We tend to have eureka insights when we've been mulling over a problem for some time. Take, for example, the time two helicopter mechanics in the Army Reserve saved the army tens of millions of dollars because of their shared love of NASCAR.<br><br> During the Iraq War, desert sand and dust were damaging helicopter windshields faster than the army could replace them, and costing hundreds of thousands of dollars every month. Lexan, the shatter-resistant plastic the windshields were made of, tended to scratch easily.<br><br> As it happens, Lexan is also used to make NASCAR windshields. But to solve the scratching problem, NASCAR drivers had learned to cover their windshields with thin sheets of transparent Mylar film they called "tearaways." At the end of each race, the used Mylar sheet is torn off, and the Lexan windshield underneath is left without a scratch.<br><br> Two national guardsmen on a helicopter maintenance crew in Virginia happened to be big NASCAR fans. As they surveyed the extent of the damage done to their helicopters' Lexan windshields, they were hit with the possibility that NASCAR's solution could offer in solving the army's problem. Creatively reapplying an existing solution is a common type of eureka insight. In fact, NASCAR first borrowed the Mylar technique from motorcycle racers protecting their helmets.<br><br> When eureka breakthroughs happen, they happen fast. They are the proverbial lightning bolt over the head. Many people report the sensation of receiving information from a location "above." And this sudden discovery of an immediately applicable solution is incredibly exciting.<br><br> Eureka insights are the ones that your author Olivia gets most often (she's ruthlessly pragmatic). These ideas arrive with a clear mental picture of how to execute them and the confidence that they'll work.<br><br> They are most likely to come when you have been living with a problem or a block. This problem is interfering with your peace of mind; you think about it often during the day. But the actual breakthrough will most likely occur when you're no longer thinking about the problem.<br><br> James Watt did not invent the steam engine. In 1764, at the University of Glasgow, he was repairing what was known as a Newcomen steam engine, which Watt considered very inefficient. He worked on the problem until one spring day in 1765, he was walking through a park when the breakthrough came to him: he needed two cylinders. Eureka! Watt's breakthrough made the engine so much more powerful and efficient that it ushered in the true age of steam.<br><br> A century later, the next great breakthrough in power occurred in a remarkably similar way. Nikola Tesla had been working on the concept of an alternating current motor for a few years. One day while walking through a park in Budapest he had a feverish vision of an alternating current motor complete with three slightly out of phase magnetic fields turning the drive shaft. The solution had appeared fully formed. Eureka!<br><br> This is part of the grand paradox of breakthrough thinking. In order to have a eureka breakthrough, you have to be deeply immersed in a problem. But then you have to let go of it, let your mind wander off and go do something else. It's while you're otherwise engaged, and not focused on the problem, that you will be rewarded with a eureka breakthrough. How to switch between these two modes-focus and lack of focus-is one of the most important things this book will teach you.<br><br> "In my experience, eureka moments happen when we face a high level of pressure," explains Victoria Spadaro Grant, CTO of pasta behemoth Barilla and one of Olivia's favorite clients, "whether the pressure is generated as a by-product of a self-imposed challenge or the result of external circumstances."<br><br> When Barilla CEO Claudio Colzani, concerned by the increasing consumption of saturated fats reported by the World Health Organization, ordered a massive reduction in saturated fats across Barilla's entire bakery portfolio, Spadaro-Grant faced a "massive challenge." As head of Research and Development for the Barilla Group, she was in charge of reformulating the portfolio and bringing it to market within five months. "At the time, we did not know how to solve the technical challenge of delivering the same eating experience with less saturated fat, not to mention implementing new manufacturing processes and addressing the multimillion euro cost and profitability impact."<br><br> With the clock ticking, Spadaro-Grant assembled "a SWAT team of only six people who were eager to try, test, break rules, and make bold decisions. We realized that with such a short time frame, we had to throw the old rule book completely out the window. That realization led to new margins of tolerance across technical solutions, manufacturing setups, formulation costs, and marketing communications. As simple as this sounds, this was the way we changed technical paradigms about how to use fats in our bakery." Eureka!<br><br> Metaphorical Breakthrough<br><br> In 1782, there was no such thing as a bullet: guns did not shoot small, tapered missiles, but rather lumps of lead known as "shot." Most people produced shot by rolling out a sheet of molten lead, waiting for it to cool, and then chopping it up. This wasn't very effective in producing smooth spheres: the projectiles were misshapen, pitted, or even completely perforated.<br><br> As a result, it was nearly impossible for anyone to shoot straight. Because of their irregular shape, the slugs would catch the wind and curve like a paper airplane; their trajectory was always unpredictable. In 1782, hitting your target had more to do with luck than with aim. Since England was in the business of ruling the world at the time, and in the midst of a war with its pesky American colonies, the ability to shoot straight was of great interest.<br><br> Producing shot was also expensive, time consuming, and labor intensive. After the chopping method, people tried pouring molten lead into spherical molds. Unfortunately, the cooling process tended to create off-center spheres, and in addition air bubbles left deep, random pits.<br><br> Enter William Watts. A prosperous plumber living in a three-story house in the town of Bristol, England, Watts experienced a week of particularly trouble some sleep. Night after night he was puzzled by the same dream: He was walking along a street when it began to rain-only it wasn't raining water, it was raining lead. The drops of lead piled up around his feet. When Watts bent down to pick one up, he saw that it was a perfectly round sphere, the ideal lead shot everyone was chasing after. Watts was dreaming about the perfect product falling from the sky. But what did it mean? Day after day he pondered that question in vain.<br><br> After a few days, tired from lack of sleep at night and from puzzling over the dream during the day, Watts went for a walk. As he went down the street he had a flash of insight and suddenly understood the meaning of his dream. He ran home and set to work.<br><br> Watts added three floors to his house, making it six stories high. He cut holes in each floor, one atop the other, and put a water tank at the bottom. Then he stood at the top of this shaft with a copper sieve and a bucket of molten lead. He poured the liquid lead through the sieve and watched as lead droplets fell the length of the shaft, landing in the cool water below with a hiss.<br><br> He ran downstairs, dipped his hand into the well, and pulled up a handful of beautifully round lead shot. The even pull of gravity in the stillness of the airshaft had produced perfect spheres. Watts had invented a process to make it rain bullets, turning his dream into reality. Patented in 1783, these "shot towers," as they came to be known, sprang up all over England, Europe, and America.<br><br> Watts's mind had presented him with a solution indirectly: his brain came up with an analogy and shared it through a dream. Watts dreamed that he was walking in a rain of little lead pellets, had the same dream for a week without knowing what to make of it, then finally had a revelation, and the insight that his mind was trying to communicate became clear.<br><br> Metaphorical insights aren't as direct as eureka insights. Answers come to you first as metaphors or analogies, and you must interpret their images before the breakthrough is complete. With Archimedes' eureka insight, the answer came fully formed. There was no need to interpret a metaphor: the submersion of his leg was a direct correlation to the submersion of the crown.<br><br> If Watts's insight had been a eureka insight, he would have seen a concrete solution: an image of a tower, of drops of metal falling and being shaped into spheres by friction with the air, landing in water, and cooling down. It would have been a one-to-one correlation. Instead, he had a dream about rain, and then saw that the drops of rain were drops of lead. It was raining lead. The elements were there: the lead, the fall, the water. But there wasn't a direct correlation; a process of interpretation was necessary.</p><h2>834 Kitchen Quick Tips: Techniques And Shortcuts for the Curious Cook</h2><p>Presents a series of techniques and tips for solving common kitchen problems in preparing and serving meats, fruits, vegetables, spices, and condiments.</p><p>America&#x2019;s Test Kitchen is a real place: a no-nonsense, fully equipped test kitchen located just outside Boston, MA, where a team of highly qualified test cooks and editors perform thousands of tests every year.

Edwards had hosted NPR's Morning Edition since its late 1979 inception when the nonpareil sportscaster was persuaded to make a weekly appearance on the program. Almost every Friday from 1981 until Barber's death last October at age 84, the author (at the mike in a Washington, D.C., studio) and ``the ole redhead'' (speaking via satellite from his retirement home in Tallahassee) chatted at 7:35 a.m. EST. The four-minute spots soon became one of the NPR network's most popular features, thanks mainly to the discursive charm of the sometime voice of the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Yankees. Barber offered knowledgeable commentary on a wealth of subjects, including camellias, cats, the English language (which he employed with elegant precision), literature, race relations, religion, and, of course, the wide world of sport. Owing to hard labor as a play-by-play announcer for high-school basketball tournaments in his salad days, however, the Mississippi native didn't have much use for the court game. Nor was Barber an unfailingly lovable fellow: He could turn flinty and sternly demanding when an associate didn't meet his high standards of accuracy or integrity. As Edwards nonetheless makes clear through generous samples of their unscripted dialogues, short takes on Barber's career, anecdotal material gleaned from colleagues, and Red's influence on the author's own life, the stylish southerner was a genuinely good man off the air as well as on. An affectionate and affecting tribute to a friend who seldom was at a loss for words. (Photographs--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Red Barber, who made his reputation as a baseball broadcaster in Cincinnati, Brooklyn and the Bronx, spent the years from 1980 until his death in 1992 at age 84 doing five-minute spots on National Public Radio's "Morning Edition" with Edwards. This affecting reminiscence is a chronicle of those years, with excerpts from tapes of the show about sports, flowers, cats (Barber was an unregenerate ailurophile) and religion (he was a lay reader in the Episcopal Church, authorized to preach sermons). It is also the account of the friendship that developed between the two men and of a mentor who taught his protege by example. The author includes tales of Barber's glory days and his association with figures from Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese to Ethel Merman and Ethel Barrymore, and goes on to his battles against deafness, blindness and the progression of his beloved wife's Alzheimer's disease. The book should have a wide appeal.

In spite of his diabolical wit, reality proves to be more slippery than Humbert's feverish fantasies, and Lolita refuses to conform to his image of the perfect lover.<p> Playfully perverse in form as well as content, riddled with puns and literary allusions, Nabokov's 1955 novel is a hymn to the Russian-born author's delight in his adopted language. Indeed, readers who want to probe all of its allusive nooks and crannies will need to consult the annotated edition. <i>Lolita</i> is undoubtedly, brazenly erotic, but the eroticism springs less from the "frail honey-hued shoulders ... the silky supple bare back" of little Lo than it does from the wantonly gorgeous prose that Humbert uses to recount his forbidden passion: </p><blockquote> She was musical and apple-sweet ... Lola the bobby-soxer, devouring her immemorial fruit, singing through its juice ... and every movement she made, every shuffle and ripple, helped me to conceal and to improve the secret system of tactile correspondence between beast and beauty--between my gagged, bursting beast and the beauty of her dimpled body in its innocent cotton frock. </blockquote> Much has been made of <i>Lolita</i> as metaphor, perhaps because the love affair at its heart is so troubling. Humbert represents the formal, educated Old World of Europe, while Lolita is America: ripening, beautiful, but not too bright and a little vulgar. Nabokov delights in exploring the intercourse between these cultures, and the passages where Humbert describes the suburbs and strip malls and motels of postwar America are filled with both attraction and repulsion, "those restaurants where the holy spirit of Huncan Dines had descended upon the cute paper napkins and cottage-cheese-crested salads." Yet however tempting the novel's symbolism may be, its chief delight--and power--lies in the character of Humbert Humbert. He, at least as he tells it, is no seedy skulker, no twisted destroyer of innocence. Instead, Nabokov's celebrated mouthpiece is erudite and witty, even at his most depraved. Humbert can't help it--linguistic <i>jouissance</i> is as important to him as the satisfaction of his arrested libido. <i>--Simon Leake</i>Critics are just beginning to hail Jeremy Irons' performance for Random House AudioBooks...<p><b>"a road trip to hell in a luxury sedan." </b><br>--Salon Magazine</p><p><b>"In his reading Irons recreates the clarity, precision, and lilt of every glorious sentence." </b><br>--The Washington Post</p><p><b>"Nabokov said Lolita was the record of his love affair with the English language; Irons makes it a menage a trois." </b><br>-- Vogue</p><p><b>"[Irons's] efforts have placed this superb audio on my life list, to be saved for repeated listening."</b><br>--Boston Globe</p><p>" . . . most praiseworthy of all the audio efforts I've heard . . ."<br>-- Men's Journal</p><p><b>"Irons' inspired reading is not to be missed."</b><br> -- Chicago Tribune</p><p><b>"...a beautifully produced recording that pushes the boundaries of the audio medium.<br> . . . hands down the best audio production of the year." </b><br>-- Library Journal</p><p><b>"Irons reads with wickedly understated malevolence, preserving Humbert's foolish patrician airs.

The questions go beyond the nature of male/female to a yet-to-be-traversed region that lies somewhere between and beyond biologically determined gender. In this groundbreaking anthology, three experts in gender studies and politics navigate around rigid, societally imposed concepts of two genders to discover and illuminate the limitless possibilities of identity. Thirty first-person accounts of gender construction, exploration, and questioning provide a groundwork for cultural discussion, political action, and even greater possibilities of autonomous gender choices.

In his exciting introductory essay, MoMA curator Elderfield, who organized the exhibit, interprets the artist as a painter of metaphors, signs and analogies that pointed to an internal world of the imagination. No mere hedonist, Matisse mistrusted visual sensations and aimed at a mode of representation that had the clarity of a text, notes Elderfield, who brilliantly deconstructs the artist's pictorial language. Elderfield shows that the myth of a Golden Age, expressed in images of luxury and erotic fulfillment, is a key influence on a man who decisively altered the way we look at pictures. While the focus here is on painting, numerous drawings, sculptures, prints and stained-glass window designs are also reproduced. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Fantasies of Robert A. Heinlein</h2><p>Robert A. Heinlein, the dean of American SF writers, also wrote fantasy fiction throughout his long career, but especially in the early 1940s. The Golden Age of SF was also a time of revolution in fantasy fiction, and Heinlein was at the forefront. His fantasies were convincingly set in the real world, particularly those published in the famous magazine <i>Unknown Worlds, </i>including such stories as "Magic, Inc.," "'They--,'" and "The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag." Now all of Heinlein's best fantasy short stories, most of them long novellas, have been collected in one big volume for the first time.<br></p><p>Robert A. Heinlein (1907-1988) was one of the most influential SF writers of any era (four of his 31 novels won Hugos, and he was the first to receive the Science Fiction Writers of America Grand Master Award). <i>The Fantasies of Robert A. Heinlein</i> gives newer SF readers and fans a less-known side of his work and opportunity to savor crisp sentences filled with telling detail, sardonic observations of character, and engrossing tales. <p> The stories, originally published in the 1940s and '50s, showcase Heinlein's science-fictional approach to fantasy. Though magic works and the supernatural underlies ordinary life, the reader is always firmly anchored in a lawful reality. The setting is the USA, sometimes in the mid-20th century, sometimes in a near future, always featuring very American characters. It's just that the salesman sells elephants and encounters fictional characters and ghosts ("The Man Who Traveled in Elephants"), the reporter covers a sentient whirlwind that collects old newspaper ("Our Fair City"), and the bartender is a time-traveling recruiter ("All You Zombies"). The ambitious, young California architect builds a house where doors and windows open on many places--but not to the outside he came in from ("And He Built a Crooked House"). And the paranoid patient's reality is saner than you think ("They"). The three novellas: "Magic, Inc.," "Waldo," and "The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag" are vintage Heinlein; the last is a Lovecraftian tale of an amnesiac who hires PIs to find out what he does all day--what they uncover isn't illegal but <i>is</i> supernaturally evil, and Hoag is neither perpetrator nor victim.</p><p> These stories feel a bit old-fashioned, but no one ignited the sense of wonder in readers better than Heinlein. This collection offers a golden opportunity to sample a master at his best. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>Robert Anson Heinlein was educated at the University of Missouri and the U.S. Naval Academy. After serving as a naval officer for five years, he retired for health reasons and began publishing SF in 1939. Considered the dean of American SF writers, Heinlein was loved and emulated during the half century that he wrote SF. He wrote dozens of novels and short stories, including <i>Double Star, Stranger in a Strange Land</i>, and<i> The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,</i> all of which won Hugo Awards. Heinlein was the recipient of the First Grand Master Nebula in 1975, and he was the guest of honor at three World SF Conventions: in 1941, 1961, and 1976. He has repeatedly been voted "best all-time author" in readers' polls. Robert A. Heinlein passed away in 1988.<br></p><h2>Asking For It</h2><p>Emma O'Donovan is eighteen, beautiful, and fearless.

The woman was waving what turned out to be a wet suit. She was trying to attract the helicopter crew&#x2019;s attention.</p><p>The helicopter, a Jayhawk H-60, was in the area searching for a twenty-five-foot pleasure boat that had been reported overdue nearly two days earlier. According to the report, the motor vessel, Seminole Wind, had left Marco on Friday morning with a party of one man, three women. According to relatives, the foursome had planned to spend the day offshore, fishing and SCUBA diving, but did not return Friday afternoon as expected. The Coast Guard had been searching for the Seminole Wind since Friday night. The crew of the Jayhawk was looking for a disabled boat, not a naked woman waving a wet suit from a light tower.</p><p>The helicopter flew east past the tower, banked south, then hovered beside the platform. One of the crew signaled the woman with a thumbs-up. It was a question. The woman signaled a thumbs-up in return she was okay. Then the woman wiggled into her wet suit, climbed down to a lower platform, and dived into the water. The crew of the Jayhawk dropped a basket seat and winched her aboard.</p><p>It was 9:54 a.m.</p><p>The woman they rescued was thirty-six-year-old Amelia Gardner of St. Petersburg, a passenger on the vessel that had been reported overdue, the Seminole Wind.</p><p>According to the Coast Guard report, the woman was given a mug of coffee from a Thermos and asked what happened. She replied that she&#x2019;d been a guest on a boat that sank. When the crew chief asked where the boat had sunk, Gardner replied, &#x201c;Oh dear, God! You mean you haven&#x2019;t found them?&#x201d;</p><p>She was referring to the two women and one man who&#x2019;d been aboard with her: the boat&#x2019;s owner, Michael Sanford, age thirty-five, of Siesta Key; Grace Walker, twenty-nine, a Sarasota realtor; and Janet Mueller, thirty-three, who lived on a houseboat at Jensen&#x2019;s Marina on Captiva Island and worked part-time for Sanibel Biological Supply, a business owned by a man named Marion Ford.</p><p>A Coast Guard crewman shook his head and told the distraught woman, &#x201c;Nope. We&#x2019;ve had crews searching for thirty-six hours straight and no one&#x2019;s seen a thing.&#x201d;</p><p>Gardner told the crew that Sanford&#x2019;s boat had swamped and capsized at around 3 p.m. Friday while anchored over the Baja California, a wreck they&#x2019;d been diving. She said the four of them had held on to the anchor line until the boat finally sank at around 7 p.m. and they were set adrift. By then, it was dark, waves had gotten bigger, the wind stronger, and she was gradually swept away from the others in rough seas. Because she had no other options, Gardner began swimming toward the light tower, which she&#x2019;d been told was approximately four miles away.</p><p>&#x201c;I never thought I was going to make it,&#x201d; she told the crew chief. &#x201c;I was sure I was going to die.&#x201d;</p><p>She said that it was a little after 11 p.m., according to her dive watch, when she finally reached the tower, climbed up the service ladder, and collapsed, exhausted, on the lower platform. She&#x2019;d been on the tower since 11 p.m. Friday thirty-five hours and she told them she was very thirsty. She was sunburned, she had barnacle cuts on her hands and legs, and she appeared to be suffering from exposure.</p><p>When Gardner was offered the option of being flown to a hospital or remaining on station, she replied that she wanted the helicopter to continue searching. She told crewmen that all three of her companions were wearing wet suits and inflated BCD vests, buoyancy compensator devices. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll find them, we&#x2019;ve got to find them,&#x201d; she said, and offered to help the crew get Loran an electronic navigational system that aids mariners in determining positions at sea coordinates for the California wreck from her former dive instructor, who lived aboard a trawler at Burnt Store Marina near Punta Gorda.</p><p>The crew chief told Gardner that they already had the coordinates for the wreck.</p><p>The helicopter crew, with Gardner aboard, searched for two more hours but found nothing nor did what, by now, was an even bigger search group that included a second H-60 helicopter, a C-130 fixed wing aircraft, the Coast Guard&#x2019;s eighty-two-foot cutter Point Swift, and a forty-one-foot utility cruiser. The U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary and other volunteers were also providing boats and crew, but the smaller vessels could not search offshore because the wind was now blowing twenty knots out of the east-northeast.</p><p>Hopes of recovering the three missing divers remained high, however. They were all young, all in good shape, and they were all wearing wet suits and inflated vests.</p><p>As one of the Coast Guard staff assured Gardner, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, we&#x2019;re the very best in the world at finding people lost at sea.&#x201d;</p><p>Which is true. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>A Piece of My Soul: Quilts by Black Arkansans</h2><p>Arkansas is well known for its rich tradition of upland folk arts. Little, however, has been reported from the lowland areas, particulary on African American contributions to the state&#39;s cultural heritage. A Piece of My Soul: Quilts by Black Arkansans seeks to rectify that oversight by drawing attention to the extensive, important collection of African American quilts in the Old State House Museum in Little Rock. Over seventy-five individual pieces of patchwork art are presented in this publication in full-color plates, each with a commentary by the exhibit&#39;s guest curator, Cuesta Benberry. The book details the importance of quilting to black Arkansans; the quilts&#39; uses, materials and construction; and what each piece says about the artist and her beliefs. We are granted a glimpse into the living conditions and cultural mores of the quilters&#39; lives.

Guy Carson and Susana Cabeza de Vaca have come to Mount Dragon to work shoulder to shoulder with some of the greatest scientific minds on the planet. Led by visionary genius Brent Scopes, their secret goal is a medical breakthrough that promises to bring incalculable benefits to the human race. But while Scopes believes he is leading the way to a new world order, he may in fact be opening the door to mass human extinction. And when Guy and Susana attempt to stop him they find themselves locked in a frightening battle with Scopes, his henchmen, and the apocalyptic nightmare that science has unleashed.</p><p>DOUGLAS PRESTON has worked for the American Museum of Natural History as well as being a contributor to <i>The New Yorker.</i> He is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Codex</i> and <i>Tyrannosaur Canyon.</i> <i>Relic</i> was the first book in his many <i>New York Times</i> bestselling collaborations with Lincoln Child, including <i>Dance of Death,</i> <i>Brimstone, The Cabinet of Curiosities,</i> and <i>Still Life with Crows</i>.

He lives with his wife and daughter in Morristown, New Jersey.<br>Guy Carson, stuck at yet another traffic light, glanced at the clock on his dashboard. He was already late for work, second time this week. Ahead, U.S. Route 1 ran like a bad dream through Edison, New Jersey. The light turned green, but by the time he had edged up it was red again.<br>&#x201c;Son of a <i>bitch</i>&#x201d; he muttered, slamming the dashboard with the fat part of his palm. He watched as the rain splattered across the windshield, listened to the slap and whine of the wipers. The serried ranks of brake lights rippled back toward him as the traffic slowed yet again. He knew he&#x2019;d never get used to this congestion any more than he&#x2019;d get used to all the damn rain.<br>Creeping painfully over a rise, Carson could see, a mere half mile down the highway, the crisp white facade of the GeneDyne Edison complex, a postmodern masterpiece rising above green lawns and artificial ponds. Somewhere inside, Fred Peck lay in wait.<br>Carson turned on the radio, and the throbbing sound of the Gangsta Muthas filled the air. As he fiddled with the dial, Michael Jackson&#x2019;s shrill voice separated itself from the static. Carson punched it off in disgust. Some things were even worse than the thought of Peck. Why couldn&#x2019;t they have a decent country station in this hole?<br>* * *<br>The lab was bustling when he arrived, Peck nowhere in sight. Carson drew the lab coat over his lanky frame and sat down at his terminal, knowing his log-on time would automatically go into his personnel file. If by some miracle Peck was out sick, he&#x2019;d be sure to notice when he came in. Unless he had died, of course. Now, that was something to think about. The man did look like a walking heart attack.<br>&#x201c;Ah, Mr. Carson,&#x201d; came the mocking voice behind him. &#x201c;How kind of you to grace us with your presence this morning.&#x201d; Carson closed his eyes and took a deep breath, then turned around.<br>The soft form of his supervisor was haloed by the fluorescent light. Peck&#x2019;s brown tie still bore testament to that morning&#x2019;s scrambled eggs, and his generous jowls were mottled with razor burn. Carson exhaled through his nose, fighting a losing battle with the heavy aroma of Old Spice.<br>It had been a shock on Carson&#x2019;s first day at GeneDyne, one of the world&#x2019;s premier biotechnology companies, to find a man like Fred Peck there waiting for him. In the eighteen months since, Peck had gone out of his way to keep Carson busy with menial lab work. Carson guessed it had something to do with Peck&#x2019;s lowly M.S. from Syracuse University and his own Ph.D. from MIT. Or maybe Peck just didn&#x2019;t like Southwestern hicks.<br>&#x201c;Sorry I&#x2019;m late,&#x201d; he said with what he hoped would pass for sincerity. &#x201c;Got caught in traffic.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Traffic,&#x201d; said Peck, as if the word was new to him.<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Carson, &#x201c;they&#x2019;ve been rerouting&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Re<i>routin</i>&#x2019;,&#x201d; Peck repeated, imitating Carson&#x2019;s Western twang.<br>&#x201c;&#x2014;detouring, I mean, the traffic from the Jersey Turn-pike&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ah, the <i>Turnpike</i>,&#x201d; Peck said.<br>Carson fell silent.<br>Peck cleared his throat. &#x201c;traffic in New Jersey at rush hour. What an unexpected shock it must have been for you, Carson.&#x201d; He crossed his arms. &#x201c;You almost missed your meeting.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Meeting?&#x201d; Carson said. &#x201c;What meeting? I didn&#x2019;t know&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course you didn&#x2019;t know. I just heard about it myself. That&#x2019;s one of the many reasons you have to be here on time, Carson.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, Mr. Peck,&#x201d; Carson said, getting up and following Peck past a maze of identical cubicles. Mr. Fred Peckerwood. Sir Frederick Peckerfat. He was itching to deck the oily bastard. But that wasn&#x2019;t the way they did business around here. If Peck had been a ranch boss, the man would&#x2019;ve been on his ass in the dirt long ago.<br>Peck opened a door marked videoconferencing room ii and waved Carson inside. It was only as Carson looked around the large, empty table within that he realized he was still wearing his filthy lab coat.<br>&#x201c;Take a seat,&#x201d; Peck said.<br>&#x201c;Where is everybody?&#x201d; Carson asked.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just you,&#x201d; Peck replied. He started to back out the door.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not staying?&#x201d; Carson felt a rising uncertainty, wondering if he&#x2019;d missed an important piece of e-mail, if he should have prepared something. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this about, anyway?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I have no idea,&#x201d; Peck replied. &#x201c;Carson, when you&#x2019;re finished here, come straight down to my office. We need to talk about your attitude.&#x201d;<br>The door shut with the solid click of oak engaging steel. Carson gingerly took a seat at the cherrywood table and looked around. It was a beautiful room, finished in hand-rubbed blond wood. A wall of windows looked out over the meadows and ponds of the GeneDyne complex. Beyond lay endless urban waste. Carson tried to compose himself for whatever ordeal was coming. Probably Peck had sent in enough negative ratings on him to merit a stem lecture from personnel, or worse.<br>In a way, he supposed, Peck was right his attitude could certainly be improved. He had to rid himself of the stubborn bad-ass outlook that did in his father. Carson would never forget that day on the ranch when his father sucker-punched a banker. That incident had been the start of the foreclosure proceedings. His father had been his own worst enemy, and Carson was determined not to repeat his mistakes. There were a lot of Pecks in the world.<br>But it was a goddamn shame, the way the last year and a half of his life had been flushed virtually down the toilet. When he was first offered the job at GeneDyne, it had seemed the pivotal moment of his life, the one thing he&#x2019;d left home and worked so hard for. And still, more than anything, GeneDyne stood out as one place where he could really make a difference, maybe do something important. But each day that he woke up in hateful Jersey&#x2014;to the cramped, unfamiliar apartment, the gray industrial sky, and Peck&#x2014;it seemed less and less likely.<br>The lights of the conference room dimmed and went out. Window shades were automatically drawn, and a large panel slid back from the wall, revealing a bank of keyboards and a large video-projection screen.<br>The screen flickered on, and a face swam into focus. Carson froze. There they were: the jug ears, the sandy hair, the unrepentant cowlick, the thick glasses, the trademark black T-shirt, the sleepy, cynical expression. All the features that together made up the face of Brentwood Scopes, founder of GeneDyne. The <i>Time</i> issue with the cover article on Scopes still lay next to Carson&#x2019;s living-room couch. The CEO who ruled his company from cyberspace. Lionized on Wall Street, worshipped by his employees, feared by his rivals. What was this, some kind of motivational film for hard cases?<br>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; said the image of Scopes. &#x201c;How&#x2019;re you doing, Guy?&#x201d;<br>For a moment Carson was speechless. <i>Jesus</i>, he thought, <i>this isn&#x2019;t a film at all</i>. &#x201c;Uh, hello, Mr. Scopes. Sir. Fine. Sorry, I&#x2019;m not really dressed&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Please call me Brent. And face the screen when you talk. I can see you better that way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not sir. Brent.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Right. Thanks, Brent.&#x201d; Just calling the supreme leader of GeneDyne by his first name was painfully difficult.<br>&#x201c;I like to think of my employees as colleagues,&#x201d; Scopes said. &#x201c;After all, when you joined the company, you became a principal in the business, like everyone else. You own stock in this company, which means we all rise and fall together.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, Brent.&#x201d; In the background, behind the image of Scopes, Carson could make out the dim outlines of what looked like a massive, many-sided vault.<br>Scopes smiled, as if unashamedly pleased at the sound of his name, and as he smiled it seemed to Carson that he looked almost like a teenager, despite being thirty-nine. He watched Scopes&#x2019;s image with a growing sense of unreality. Why would Scopes, the boy genius, the man who built a four-billion-dollar company out of a few kernels of ancient corn, want to talk to him? <i>Shit, I must have screwed up worse than I thought</i>.<br>Scopes glanced down for a moment, and Carson could hear the tapping of keys. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been looking into your background, Guy,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Very impressive. I can see why we hired you.&#x201d; More tapping. &#x201c;Although I can&#x2019;t quite understand why you&#x2019;re working as, let&#x2019;s see, a Lab Technician Three.&#x201d;<br>Scopes looked up again. &#x201c;Guy, you&#x2019;ll forgive me if I get right to the point. There&#x2019;s an important post in this company that&#x2019;s currently vacant. 1 think you&#x2019;re the person for it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Carson blurted, instantly regretting his own excitement.<br>Scopes smiled again. &#x201c;I wish I could give you specifics, but it&#x2019;s a highly confidential project. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll understand if 1 only describe the assignment in general terms.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do I look like a &#x2018;sir&#x2019; to you, Guy? It wasn&#x2019;t so long ago that I was just the nerdy kid being picked on in the schoolyard. What I <i>can</i> tell you is that this assignment involves the most important product GeneDyne has ever produced. One that will be of incalculable value to the human race.&#x201d;<br>Scopes saw the look on Carson&#x2019;s face and grinned. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s great,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;when you can help people and get rich at the same time.&#x201d; He brought his face closer to the camera. &#x201c;What we&#x2019;re offering you is a six-month reassignment to the GeneDyne Remote Desert Testing Facility. The Mount Dragon laboratory. You&#x2019;ll be working with a small, dedicated team, the best microbiologists in the company.&#x201d;<br>Carson felt a surge of excitement. Just the words <i>Mount Dragon</i> were like a magic talisman throughout all of GeneDyne: a scientific Shangri-la.<br>A pizza box was laid at Scopes&#x2019;s elbow by someone offscreen. He glanced at it, opened it up, shut the lid. &#x201c;Ah! Anchovies. You know what Churchill said about anchovies: &#x2018;A delicacy favored by English lords and Italian whores.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>There was a short silence. &#x201c;So I&#x2019;d be going to New Mexico?&#x201d; Carson asked.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s correct. Your part of the country, right?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I grew up in the Bootheel. At a place called Cottonwood Tanks.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I knew it had a picturesque name. You probably won&#x2019;t find Mount Dragon as harsh as some of our other people have. The isolation and the desert setting can make it a difficult place to work. But you might actually enjoy it. There are horse stables there. I suppose you must be a fairly good rider, having grown up on a ranch.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know a bit about horses,&#x201d; Carson said. Scopes had sure as hell done his research.<br>&#x201c;Not that you&#x2019;ll have much time for riding, of course. They&#x2019;ll run you ragged, no point in saying otherwise. But you&#x2019;ll be well compensated for it. A year&#x2019;s salary for the six-month tour, plus a fifty&#x2019;thousand-dollar bonus upon successful completion. And, of course, you&#x2019;ll have my personal gratitude.&#x201d;<br>Carson struggled with what he was hearing. The bonus alone equaled his current salary.<br>&#x201c;You probably know my management methods are a little unorthodox,&#x201d; Scopes continued. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be straight with you, Guy. There&#x2019;s a downside to this. If you fail to complete your part of the project in the necessary time frame, you&#x2019;ll be ex-cessed.&#x201d; He grinned, displaying oversized front teeth. &#x201c;But I have every confidence in you. I wouldn&#x2019;t put you in this position if I didn&#x2019;t think you could do it.&#x201d;<br>Carson had to ask. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t help wondering why you chose me out of such a vast pool of talent.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Even that I can&#x2019;t tell you. When you get briefed at Mount Dragon, everything will become clear, I promise.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;When would I begin?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Today. The company needs this product, Guy, and there&#x2019;s simply no time left. You can be on our plane before lunch. I&#x2019;ll have someone take care of your apartment, car, all the annoying details. Do you have a girlfriend?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Carson.<br>&#x201c;That makes things easier.&#x201d; Scopes smoothed down his cowlick, without success.<br>&#x201c;What about my supervisor, Fred Peck? I was supposed to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no time. Just grab your PowerBook and go. The driver will take you home to pack a few things and call whoever. I&#x2019;ll send what&#x2019;s-his-name&#x2014;Peck?&#x2014;a note explaining things.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Brent, I want you to know&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>Scopes held up a hand. &#x201c;Please. Expressions of gratitude make me uncomfortable. &#x2018;Hope has a good memory, gratitude a bad one.&#x2019; Give my offer ten minutes&#x2019; serious thought, Guy, and don&#x2019;t go anywhere.&#x201d;<br>The screen winked out on Scopes opening the pizza box again.<br>As the lights came on, Carson&#x2019;s feeling of unreality was replaced by a surge of elation. He had no idea why Scopes had reached down among the five thousand GeneDyne Ph.D.s and picked him, busy with his repetitive titrations and quality-control checks. But for the moment he didn&#x2019;t care. He thought of Peck hearing thirdhand that Scopes had personally assigned him to Mount Dragon. He thought of the look on the fat face, the wattles quivering in consternation.<br>There was a low rumbling noise as the curtains drew back from the windows, exposing the dreary vista beyond, cloaked in curtains of rain. In the gray distance, Carson could make out the power lines and smokestacks and chemical effluvia that were central New Jersey. Somewhere farther west lay a desert, with eternal sky and distant blue mountains and the pungent smell of greasewood, where you could ride all day and night and never see another human being. Somewhere in that desert stood Mount Dragon, and within it, his own secret chance to do something important.<br>Ten minutes later, when the curtains closed and the video screen came once again to life, Carson had his answer ready.<br>Copyright � 1996 by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child</p><h2>Assassin&#39;s Game: A David Slaton Novel (David Slaton, 1)</h2><p><p>After decades of work, a brilliant scientist, Dr. Ibrahim Hamedi, has taken Iran to the threshold of its dream&#x2015;a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile.

The major innovations that he was able to achieve in photography, optics, industry, and science policy carry priceless lessons for readers today.Insisting on the Impossible is the first full-scale biography of this Magellan of modern technology. Victor McElheny reveals the startling scope and dating spirit of Land's scientific and entrepreneurial genius. Second only to Edison in the number of patents he received (535), Land build a modest enterprise into a gigantic &#x201d;invention factory,&#x201d; turning out not only polarizers and the first instant cameras, but also high-speed and X-ray film, identification systems, 3-D and instant movies, and military devices for night vision and aerial reconnaissance. As a scientist, Land developed a new theory of color vision; as a science advisor to Eisenhower during the Cold War he spearheaded the development of the U-2 spyplane and helped design NASA.Behind these protean achievements was a relentless curiosity, a magical public presence, and a willful optimism that drew him again and again to conquer &#x201d;the impossible.&#x201d; In an era when these qualities are needed more than ever, this masterly biography will speak to anyone involved or interested in business, science, photography, educational reform of government.</p><p>The inventions of Edwin Land made Polaroid a great company--and later accelerated its decline. <i>Insisting on the Impossible</i>, written by former <i>New York Times</i> reporter Victor K. McElheny, tells the story of one of the early giants in photographic technology.<p> McElheny follows Land's career from before the founding of Polaroid in 1937 through the release of the landmark SX-70 camera in the early '70s. Land invented instant photography and turned his company into a tremendous success and a Wall Street darling in the '60s and '70s. Land was a bulldog about patents--he trails only Thomas Edison in number of patents he received (535). But while the protection of the U.S. patent system helped Polaroid fend off attacks by its chief nemesis, Kodak, they couldn't shield Land from his own shortcomings. Land tended to lose track of business costs and he sometimes took criticism too personally. And he disdained market research. McElheny writes that Land's business philosophy boiled down to "making things that people didn't know they wanted until they were available." One of Land's final inventions--instant movies--loaded Polaroid with debt and sped his departure from the company he founded. Unlike instant photography, nobody wanted "Polavision." It lacked sound and the film was too short. It was soon overwhelmed by the more popular and practical videocassette tape. Land's instant photography also fell out of favor. It couldn't compete with Kodak Instamatics, improved 35mm cameras, and fully automatic digital cameras.</p><p> Land, who died in 1991, was bitter by the time he left Polaroid.

In his newest novel Kellerman delivers a tour de force&#x2013;poignant, dark, and chilling&#x2013;that illuminates a shadowy world where impulse rules. <br><br>Tanya Bigelow was a solemn little girl when Dr. Alex Delaware successfully treated her obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Now, at nineteen, she still seems older than her years&#x2013;but her problems go beyond hyper-maturity. Patty Bigelow, Tanya&#x2019;s aunt and adoptive mother, has made a deathbed confession of murder and urged the young woman to seek Delaware&#x2019;s help. The doctor recalls Patty as a selfless E.R. nurse struggling to raise a child on her own&#x2013;a woman seemingly incapable of the &#x201c;terrible thing&#x201d; she has admitted. But for Tanya&#x2019;s peace of mind, Delaware agrees to investigate, and he enlists LAPD detective Milo Sturgis in the search for the phantom victim of a crime that may never have occurred.<br><br>Armed with only the vaguest details, psychologist and cop follow a trail twisting from L.A.&#x2019;s sleaziest low-rent districts to its overblown mansions, retracing Patty and Tanya&#x2019;s nomadic and increasingly puzzling life to the doorsteps of a sullen heroin addict; a randy real-estate broker; and a brilliant, enigmatic physics student. Suddenly a very real murder tears open a terrifying tunnel into the past, where secrets&#x2013;and bodies&#x2013;are buried. As the tension mounts, Delaware and Sturgis uncover a tangled history of desperation, vengeance, and death&#x2013;a legacy of evil that refuses to die. <br><br>Dramatic, action-packed, and filled with the psychological detail that only Jonathan Kellerman can provide, Obsession is a whodunit, a whydunit&#x2013;and something unique: a did-it-even-happen? This is Kellerman at his heart-racing best.</p><p>Jonathan Kellerman is one of the world&#x2019;s most popular authors. He has brought his expertise as a clinical psychologist to over two dozen bestselling crime novels, including the Alex Delaware series, The Butcher&#x2019;s Theater, Billy Straight, The Conspiracy Club, and Twisted.

God had other ideas.<br><br>Patty&#x2019;s concept of a supreme being wavered between Ho-Ho-Ho Santa and a Fire-Eyed Odin thrusting thunderbolts.<br><br>Either way, a white-bearded guy bunking down in the clouds. Depending on his mood, dispensing goodies or playing marbles with the planets.<br><br>If pressed, Patty would&#x2019;ve called herself an agnostic. But when life went haywire why not be like everyone else and blame A Greater Power?<br><br>The night Lydia surprised her, Patty had been home for a couple of hours, trying to wind down after a tough day in the E.R. Mellowing out with a beer, then another, and when that didn&#x2019;t work, giving in to The Urge.<br><br>First, she straightened the apartment, doing stuff that didn&#x2019;t need doing. She ended up using a toothbrush on the kitchen counter grout, cleaned the toothbrush with a wire brush that she washed under hot water and picked clean. Still tense, she saved the best for last: arranging her shoes&#x2014;wiping each loafer, sneaker, and sandal clean with a chamois, sorting and re-sorting by color, making sure everything pointed outward at precisely the same angle.<br><br>Time for blouses and sweaters . . . the doorbell rang.<br><br>One twenty a.m. in Hollywood, who the heck would be drop- ping in?<br><br>Patty got irritated, then nervous. Should&#x2019;ve bought that gun. She took a carving knife to the door, made sure to use the peephole.<br><br>Saw black sky, no one out there . . . oh, yes there was.<br><br>When she realized what Lydia had done, she stood there, too stunned to blame anyone.<br>Lydia Bigelow Nardulli Soames Biefenbach was Patty&#x2019;s baby sister but she&#x2019;d crammed a lot more living into her thirty-five years than Patty wanted to think about.<br><br>Dropout years, groupie years, barmaid years, sitting-on-back-of-the-Harley years. Vegas, Miami, San Antonio, Fresno, Mexico, New Mexico, Wyoming, Montana. No time for postcards or sisterly calls, the only time Patty heard from Liddie had to do with money.<br><br>Lydia was quick to point out that the arrests were chickenshit, nothing that ever stuck. Responding to Patty&#x2019;s silence when she collect-called from some backcountry lockup and wheedled bail money.<br><br>She always paid the money back, Patty granted her that. Always the same schedule: six months later, to the day.<br><br>Liddie could be efficient when she wanted to, but not when it came to men. Before, in between, and after the three stupid marriages flowed an endless parade of pierced, inked, dirty-fingernailed, vacant-eyed losers who Liddie insisted on calling her &#x201c;honeys.&#x201d;<br><br>All that fooling around, but miraculously only one kid.<br><br>Three years ago, Lydia taking twenty-three hours to push the baby out, alone in some osteopathic hospital outside of Missoula. Tanya Marie, five pounds, six ounces. Liddie sent Patty a newborn picture and Patty sent money. Most newborns were red and monkeylike but this kid looked pretty cute. Two years later, Lydia and Tanya showed up at Patty&#x2019;s door, dropping in on the way to Alaska.<br><br>No talk about why Juneau, were they meeting anyone, was Liddie clean. No hints about who the father was. Patty wondered if Lydia even knew.<br><br>Patty was no kid person and her neck got tight when she saw the toddler holding Liddie&#x2019;s hand. Expecting some wild little brat, given the circumstances. Her niece turned out to be sweet and quiet, kind of pretty with wispy white-blond hair, searching green eyes that would&#x2019;ve fit a middle-aged woman, and restless hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Drop-in&#x201d; stretched to a ten-day stay. Patty ended up deciding Tanya was real cute, not much of a pain, if you didn&#x2019;t count the stink of dirty diapers.<br><br>Just as suddenly as she&#x2019;d shown up, Liddie announced they were leaving.<br><br>Patty was relieved but also disappointed. &#x201c;You did okay, Lid, she&#x2019;s a real little lady.&#x201d; Standing in her front door, watching as Lydia dragged the kid out with one hand, toted a battered suitcase with the other. A Yellow Cab idled at the curb, belching smog. Noise rose from down on the boulevard. Across the street a bum slouched past.<br><br>Lydia flipped her hair and grinned. Her once-gorgeous smile was insulted by two seriously chipped front teeth.<br><br>&#x201c;A lady? Meaning not like me, Pats?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, stop, take it for what it was,&#x201d; said Patty.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; said Lydia, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a slut and proud of it.&#x201d; Shaking her chest and wiggling her butt. Laughing loud enough for the cabbie to turn his head.<br><br>Tanya was two but she must&#x2019;ve known Mommy was being inappropriate because she winced. Patty was sure of it.<br><br>Patty wanted to protect her. &#x201c;All I meant to say was she&#x2019;s great, you can bring her anytime.&#x201d; Smiling at Tanya but the kid was looking at the sidewalk.<br><br>Liddie laughed. &#x201c;Even with all those shitty diapers?&#x201d;<br><br>Now the kid stared off into the distance. Patty walked over to her and touched the top of her little head. Tanya started to recoil, then froze.<br><br>Patty bent a bit and talked softly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a good girl, a real little lady.&#x201d;<br><br>Tanya laced her hands in front of her and mustered up the most painful little smile Patty had ever seen.<br><br>As if some inner voice was coaching her in the fine points of niece-to-aunt etiquette.<br><br>Lydia said, &#x201c;Shitty diapers are okay? Cool, I&#x2019;ll remember that, Pats, on the off chance we ever roll around here again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s in Juneau?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Snow.&#x201d; Lydia laughed and her boobs bounced, barely restrained by a hot-pink halter top. She had tattoos now, too many of them. Her hair looked dry and coarse, her eyes were getting grainy around the edges, and those long dancer&#x2019;s legs were getting jiggly around the inner thighs. All that and the broken teeth shouted Racing Over the Hill! Patty wondered what would happen when all of Lydia&#x2019;s looks went south.<br><br>&#x201c;Stay warm,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yeah,&#x201d; said Lydia. &#x201c;I got my ways for that.&#x201d; Taking hold of the little girl&#x2019;s wrist and pulling her toward the car.<br><br>Patty went after them. Bent to get eye-level with the kid as Lydia handed the suitcase off to the cabbie. &#x201c;Nice to meet you, little Tanya.&#x201d;<br><br>That sounded awkward. What did she know about kids?<br><br>Tanya bit her lip, chewed hard.<br>Now here it was, thirteen months later, a hot night in June, the air stinking of Patty didn&#x2019;t know what, and the kid was back at her door, tiny as ever, wearing saggy jeans and a frayed white top, her hair curlier, more yellow than white.<br><br>Biting and gnawing exactly the same way. Holding a stuffed orca that was coming apart at the seams.<br><br>This time, she stared straight up at Patty.<br><br>A rumbling red Firebird was parked exactly where the cab had been. One of those souped-up numbers with a spoiler and fat tires and wire dealies clamping down the hood. The hood thumped like a fibrillating heart.<br><br>As Patty hurried toward the car the Firebird peeled out, Lydia&#x2019;s platinum shag barely visible through the tinted glass on the passenger side.<br><br>Patty thought her sister had waved, but she was never really sure.<br><br>The kid hadn&#x2019;t moved.<br><br>When Patty got back to her, Tanya reached in a pocket and held out a note.<br><br>Cheap white paper, red letterhead from the Crazy Eight Motor Hotel, Holcomb, Nevada.<br><br>Below that, Lydia&#x2019;s handwriting, way too pretty for someone with only junior high. Lydia had never put any effort into learning penmanship or anything else during those nine years but things came easy to her.<br><br>The kid started to whimper.<br><br>Patty took her hand&#x2014;cold and teeny and soft&#x2014;and read the note.<br><br>Dear Big Sis,<br><br>You said she was a lady.<br><br>Maybe with you she can really turn out to be one.<br><br>Little Sis</p><h2>Brownie a World of Girls Journey - Leaders Book (Girl Scout Journey Books, Brownie 3)</h2><p>Leader book fo the Brownie a World of Girls Journey Book</p><p></p><h2>Annapurna: A Woman&#39;s Place</h2><p>In August 1978, thirteen women left San Francisco for the Nepal Himalaya to make history as the first Americans&#x2014;and the first women&#x2014;to scale the treacherous slopes of Annapurna I, the world�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s tenth highest peak. Expedition leader Arlene Blum here tells their dramatic story: the logistical problems, storms, and hazardous ice climbing; the conflicts and reconciliations within the team; the terror of avalanches that threatened to sweep away camps and climbers. <br>On October 15, two women and two Sherpas at last stood on the summit&#x2014;but the celebration was cut short, for two days later, the two women of the second summit team fell to their deaths. <br>Never before has such an account of mountaineering triumph and tragedy been told from a woman�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s point of view. By proving that women had the skill, strength, and courage necessary to make this difficult and dangerous climb, the 1978 Women's Himalayan Expedition�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s accomplishment had a positive impact around the world, changing perceptions about women�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s abilities in sports and other arenas. And <i>Annapurna: A Woman�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s Place</i> has become an acknowledged classic in the annals of women�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s achievements&#x2014;a story of challenge and commitment told with passion, humor, and unflinching honesty.</p><p>In 1978, 13 women set out to climb Annapurna I in the Nepal Himalaya, achieving the first ascent of the world's 10th highest mountain by an American and by a woman. By proving that women had the skill, strength, and courage necessary to make this difficult and dangerous climb, the 1978 Women's Himalayan Expedition's accomplishment had a positive impact around the world, changing perceptions about women's abilities in sports and other arenas. Twenty years later, Arlene Blum has republished her account, offering her story to a new generation. Blum writes in the introduction, <blockquote>Annapurna has become for me a metaphor for difficult and important goals. Striving to achieve such objectives draws on all of our abilities and brings out the best in us. There are still many 'Annapurnas' to be climbed in the world--such as protecting our natural environment; decreasing the gap between rich and poor; providing basic necessities for everyone on this planet; and raising our children to live with love and good values.</blockquote> Impressive black-and-white photos record the women's journey from Katmandu to the summit and back again. This book documents the personal triumphs and tragedies of these women with insights that only a firsthand account can offer. <i>--Kathryn True</i>Arlene Blum is a biochemist with a doctorate in physical chemistry. In her twenty years of climbing, she has taken part in more than fifteen expeditions, including the first all-woman climb of Mount McKinley and the 1976 American Bicentennial Expedition to Mount Everest.

With the help of the family mechanic, who was also a show chicken breeder and a 4-H poultry leader, she began to raise and show chickens. The poultry community is full of kind people willing to share their knowledge with fellow poultry enthusiasts, and it was this camaraderie that spurred her on to study poultry and birds in college. She received her B.S. and M.S. in Avian Sciences from the University of California, Davis, and then received her Ph.D. in Poultry Science from Auburn University. Brigid is pleased to share her poultry knowledge with everyone who is interested in learning how best to start or serve their flock.<p><b>How a Chicken Makes an Egg </b></p><p>You reach into the nest box and wrap your fingers around a warm, just-laid egg. You pick it up, feel its warmth against your cheek, and then pop it into in your pocket. Back in the house, you heat up the fry pan and crack open your egg, staring at all of its curious parts and poking at the yolk with a spatula. This egg came from your happy hens; unhappy hens do not lay eggs so you must be doing something right. The yolk breaks open from the spatula&#x2019;s weight and spreads into the egg white. As it cooks, you wait patiently. When it is ready, you put it on a plate and serve yourself a fresh, egg-a-licious breakfast. The taste, well, those words are best left to your own imagination. But what about the journey that wonderful egg took to get to your breakfast?</p><p>The egg starts with the yolk. It begins small and is surrounded by a follicle necessary to transport the nutrients and pigments needed. Once ready&#x2014;filled with sufficient nutrients and genetic material&#x2014;the yolk descends into the oviduct, traveling first through a funnel-like section called the infundibulum. This is where it gets fertilized by sperm, if any has been stored. Next it ends up in the largest oviduct section called the magnum, where the yolk connects to the white, also called the albumen.</p><p>The next stop on the yolk&#x2019;s journey is the short, narrow isthmus, where the inner and outer shell membranes are added, the latter of which provides the foundation upon which the shell is built. The yolk and albumen spend seventy-five minutes in the isthmus. Once surrounded by the inner and outer shell membranes, the group continues on to the shell gland, where the shell gets added, hardens, and changes pigment color and where the albumen&#x2019;s four layers unfold. The egg spends more than twenty-four hours in the shell gland. Finally, the last layer, a thin protein mucus called the cuticle or bloom, seals the egg&#x2019;s pores to prevent invasion by bacteria. Now the egg is ready to be laid.</p><p>The egg is formed inside the hen with the small end facing downward. It flips around just before it is laid so that it leaves the hen large end first. The egg passes through the vagina and out through the cloaca or vent. If needed, a hen can hold onto an egg until a favorable place or situation to lay it. This is key for a wild hen avoiding a predator. In this rare circumstance, it is possible that a hen will lay two eggs within a twenty-four hour period. Whew! It takes all that to lay an egg. To all the hens in your coop: Take a bow. They have earned it!</p></p><h2>The Frank Tenney Johnson Book: A Master Painter of the Old West</h2><p>Frank Tenney Johnson (1874 - 1939) was a painter of the Old American West, and he popularized a style of painting cowboys which became known as "The Johnson Moonlight Technique".

Although much of it reads like science-fiction, <b>The Cult at the End of the World</b> is all terrifyingly true -- a tale of hi-tech horror for the 21st century. </p><p> Aum burst onto the world scene in March 1995 with a coldblooded nerve gas attack in the subways of rush-hour Tokyo. Since then, more than 30 books have appeared in Japanese on this bizarre sect -- but until now, no outside work has revealed the full story behind Aum's extraordinary reach. Investigative reporters Kaplan and Marshall spent months piecing together the cult's remarkable story, fielding a research team that spanned six countries. Among the book's many revelations: </p><p> The Cult from the Future. Aum disciples wired electrodes to their heads while chanting ancient mantras and logging onto computer nets. LSD ran through their veins, the product of laboratories that also refined enough biochemical agents to kill millions. Aum recruited hundreds of young, alienated scientists from Russia and Japan, and used them to prepare for -- and then unleash -- Armageddon. </p><p> Hi-Tech Terror. Aum's true legacy will be in sparking a new era of high-tech terrorism, say the authors. "The word is out," warn Kaplan and Marshall. "A college education, some basic lab equipment, recipes downloaded from the Internet -- for the first time, ordinary people can create extraordinary weapons. Technology and training have simply become too widespread to stop a coming era of do-it-yourself machines for mass murder." </p><p> Arms for Armageddon. In its race to doomsday, Aum assassinated its critics with nerve gas and secretly attacked the Japanese parliament and imperial family with biological weapons. "No weapon system was too far-fetched for Aum's mad scientists," say the authors. Aum built huge plants for making poison gas, explosives and machine guns; biolabs for culturing anthrax, Ebola virus and other killers; and worked on electromagnetic guns, mind control, laser and particle beams -- even an earthquake-machine. </p><p> Global Reach. Here for the first time is the full story behind Aum's shadowy expansion overseas. Using government records and interviews, Kaplan and Marshall report how the cult negotiated for a nuclear bomb in Russia, mined uranium and tested nerve agents in Australia, and ran a multi-million dollar procurement network for hi-tech goods from Silicon Valley to Switzerland. </p><p> Human Experiments. Aum ran chilling experiments on human guinea pigs, the authors reveal. Cult doctors washed out memories using massive doses of hypnotic drugs, shocked patients with high voltage and planted electrodes in their brains. The group ran its own gulag, with "psychological bombardment more suited to a North Korean brainwashing camp than a Japanese religious sect." </p><p> Bungling Police. The book offers a searing indictment of Japanese law enforcement, who have long been regarded as among the world's best cops. The authors chronicle six years of mistakes, mismanagement and missed opportunities that allowed Aum Supreme Truth to spread a worldwide web of terror. They show, as well, how the CIA and other agencies failed to see the signs, and how our governments remain woefully unprepared to deal with the new era in terror. </p><p> "Terrifying... a deadly mixture of the religious zealotry of groups such as the Branch Davidians, the anti-government agenda of the U.S. militia movements and the technical know-how of a Doctor Strangelove." -- U.S. Senate investigative report on Aum, October 1995 </p><p> A Readers Digest Condensed Book Club selection.

Invasive textile legislation, rationing and threats from German and American couturiers were pushing the design and trade of Parisian style to its limits. It is widely accepted that French fashion was severely curtailed as a result, isolated from former foreign clients and deposed of its crown as global queen of fashion. This pioneering book offers a different story. Arguing that Paris retained its hold on the international <i>haute couture</i> industry right throughout WWII, eminent dress historians and curators come together to show that, amid political, economic and cultural traumas, Paris fashion remained very much alive under the Nazi occupation &#x2013; and on an international level.</p><p>Bringing exciting perspectives to challenge a familiar story and introducing new overseas trade links out of occupied France, this book takes us from the salons of renowned couturiers such as Edward Molyneux and Robert Piguet, French <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Le Jardin des Modes</i> and luxury Lyon silk factories, to Rio de Janeiro, Denmark and Switzerland, and the great American department stores of New York. Also comparing extravagant Paris occupation styles to austerity fashions of the UK and USA, parallel industrial and design developments highlight the unresolovable tension between luxury fashion and the everyday realities of wartime life. Showing that Paris strove to maintain world dominance as leader of couture through fashion journalism, photography and exported fashion forecasting, <i>Paris Fashion in World War Two</i> makes a significant contribution to the cultural history of fashion.</p></p><p><p><b>Lou Taylor</b> is professor of dress history, formerly at the University of Brighton, UK.

This new translation, with introduction and commentary by biblical scholar Mordechai Cogan, is part of the Anchor Bible Commentary series, viewed by many as the definitive commentaries for use in both Christian and Jewish scholarship and worship. Cogan's translation brings new immediacy to well-known passages, such as Solomon's famously wise judgment when asked by two prostitutes to decide their dispute regarding motherhood of a child: "Cut the live son in two! And give half to one and half to the other." With a bibliography that runs to almost a thousand articles and books, Cogan's commentary demonstrates his mastery of the political history described by 1 Kings, as well as the themes of moral and religious failure that eventually led to Israel's defeat and exile. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p><h2>A Private Venus: A Duca Lamberti Noir (Melville International Crime)</h2><p>"A noir writer richly deserving rediscovery."<br>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br><b>The book that gave birth to Italian noir . . .</b><br><br>Milan, 1966: When Dr. Duca Lamberti is released from prison, he&#x2019;s lost his medical license and his options are few.

The fast cars, high fashion, and chic nightclubs of glitzy and swinging Milan conceal a dirty reality . . . This is no dolce vita.<br><br><i>A Private Venus</i> marks the beginning of Italian noir: Giorgio Scerbanenco pioneered a new type of novel that trained its gaze on the crime and desperation that roiled under prosperous Italian society in the 1960s. And at the heart of this book is Duca Lamberti, an unforgettable protagonist: obsessive, world-weary, unconventional in his methods, and trying hard not to make &nbsp;another fatal mistake.</p><p><b>Giorgio Scerbanenco </b>was born in Kiev in 1911 to a Ukrainian father and an Italian mother, grew up in Rome, and moved to Milan at the age of eighteen. In the 1930s, he worked as a journalist and attempted some early forays into fiction. In 1943, as German forces advanced on the city, &nbsp;Scerbanenco escaped over the Alps to Switzerland, carrying nothing but a hundred pages of a new novel he was working on. He returned to Milan in 1945 and resumed his prolific career, writing for women&#x2019;s magazines, including a very popular advice-for-the-lovelorn column, and publishing dozens of novels and short stories. But he is best known for the four books he wrote at the end of his life that make up the Milano Quartet, <i>A Private Venus</i>, <i>Traitors to All</i>, <i>The Boys of the Massacre</i>, and <i>The Milanese Kill on Saturdays</i>. Scerbanenco drew on his experiences as an orderly for the Milan Red Cross in the 1930s to create his protagonist Duca Lamberti, a disbarred doctor; it was during this period that he came to know another, more desperate side of his adopted city. The quartet of novels was immediately hailed as noir classics, and on its publication in 1966, <i>Traitors to All </i>received the most prestigious European crime prize, the Grand Prix de Litt�rature Polici�re. The annual prize for the best Italian crime novel, the Premio Scerbanenco, is named after him.

He is also the author of three novels.<p>Reviewed by David Wise</p><p>The CIA and the FBI were hugely damaged by the supermoles Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen, who ran their own private spy bazaars and peddled vast amounts of U.S. secrets to the Russians for years. No one seemed to notice when Ames drove a red Jaguar XJ6 to CIA headquarters or when the FBI's Hanssen escorted a stripper to Hong Kong.</p><p>So it is understandable that the two agencies might want the public to know that for at least a few years in the late 1990s, they had a mole sending secrets the other way. Enter Col. Sergei Tretyakov, a Russian spy who defected in New York in 2000 as the deputy rezident (station chief) there of the SVR, the successor to the KGB's foreign intelligence directorate. Some four years later, author Pete Earley found himself in a suite at the Ritz-Carlton in Tysons Corner with two FBI agents, two CIA officers, soft drinks, snacks and the defector. The meeting had been set up by an FBI agent who contacted Earley and encouraged him to write a book about the Russian. Earley, a former reporter for The Washington Post, is the author of Family of Spies, a well-received account of the John Walker naval spy ring, and Confessions of a Spy, a perceptive book about Ames that did not receive the attention it deserved, perhaps because it came out after four other books about the case, including (full disclosure) one by this reviewer. </p><p>Tretyakov, who had been assigned to the Russian mission at the United Nations since 1995 and to Ottawa before that, gave the FBI 5,000 secret SVR cables and more than 100 Russian intelligence reports, according to one U.S. intelligence official cited by Earley. Tretyakov apparently first tried to defect around 1997 but agreed to remain as an "agent in place," passing secrets to the FBI until October 2000, when he vanished from a Russian residential compound in the Bronx with his wife, daughter and cat. Four months later, the United States acknowledged his defection, but Comrade J (the title is drawn from the KGB's code name for Tretyakov, Comrade Jean) is the first account of his espionage career. "It is one of our biggest success stories," puffed the unnamed U.S. intelligence official. </p><p>Perhaps so. But to put the case in perspective, Tretyakov spied for the United States for about three years, while Ames sold secrets to Moscow for nine years (and caused the death of 10 Soviets working for the CIA), Walker spied for 18 years, and Hanssen betrayed America on and off for 22 years. Yet, if Tretyakov was not a world-class mole, he was definitely a world-class name-dropper. And that is the difficulty with his story. All defectors tend to exaggerate their own importance, or at least the importance of their information, especially if they worry that when they run out of secrets to reveal they may be cast aside.</p><p>Tretyakov's claims about Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state under President Clinton, are a case in point. "Russian intelligence had tricked and manipulated him," Tretyakov said. "He became an extremely valuable intelligence source." Georgi Mamedov, the Russian deputy minister of foreign affairs, was "a longtime co-optee" of the SVR, who met often with Talbott and who "was reporting everything that was said or done by Mr. Talbott directly to us at the Center." Employing a familiar Nixonian technique -- ironic for a KGB man -- Tretyakov is careful to add that Talbott "was not a Russian spy." Talbott, contacted by Earley, called the defector's charges "erroneous and/or misleading." When he spoke with Mamedov, Talbott said, both officials presumed they would each report everything back to their own governments.</p><p>Similarly, Tretyakov says a friend who was the KGB man in Israel had Prime Minister Golda Meir as his "main target." But Tretyakov, Earley writes, said his friend "was elusive whenever he was asked whether or not Meir had been a KGB source." And, if one is to believe Tretyakov, the KGB "created the myth of nuclear winter" in the 1980s by hornswaggling Carl Sagan and other American and foreign scientists -- although, Earley points out, whether that is true "is impossible to discern." Tretyakov also accuses Eldar Kouliev, Azerbaijan's representative to the United Nations in the 1990s, of being "a deep-cover SVR intelligence officer." And former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Earley notes, "frequently met with Kouliev." And no doubt with Strobe Talbott.</p><p>The defector describes five Canadians he says he recruited while stationed in Ottawa and gives their code designations but not their real names. He says he also recruited Alex Kindy, a former member of the Canadian parliament. He claims that Alexander Kramar was the SVR's man inside the much-criticized U.N. Oil-for-Food program -- part of the sanctions on Saddam Hussein's Iraqi regime -- and helped the Russians steal half-a-billion dollars "to line the pockets of top Russian government leaders in both the Yeltsin and Putin presidencies." Also, according to Tretyakov, before the Soviet Union collapsed, KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov sent up to $50 billion in Communist Party funds out of the country, although where the money went, nobody knows. That's an oft-told tale in Russia; Tretyakov provides no details to substantiate the story of the party gold. </p><p>The real value of Sergei Tretyakov's saga lies less in his scattershot claims and innuendoes than in his sharp eye and gossipy insider's view of the KGB/SVR's training, methods, foibles and tricks.

With the decline of cotton-based textile manufacturing in New England and the abolition of slavery, these gentleman bankers traveled far and wide in search of new business opportunities and found them in the mines, railroads, and industries of the Great West. Their investments spawned new political and social conflict, in both the urbanizing East and the expanding West. In contests that had lasting implications for wealth, government, and inequality, financial power collided with more democratic visions of economic progress.</p><p>Rather than being driven inexorably by technologies like the railroad and telegraph, the new capitalist geography was a grand and highly contentious undertaking, Maggor shows, one that proved pivotal for the rise of the United States as the world&#x2019;s leading industrial nation.</p></p><p>Noam Maggor teaches American history in the School of History at Queen Mary University of London."Maggor has produced a complex, fascinating account that is rich in local detail yet asks some very large questions...&nbsp;<i>Brahmin Capitalism&nbsp;</i>is an important contribution to the growing literature on the history of capitalism in the United States... Maggor's book offers us an important reminder of the broad impact of capitalist development and the bitter conflicts it engendered. With its vast inequalities of wealth and power, business dominance of the national government, and nationwide debates over taxation, spending, and economic regulation, the era that Mark Twain dubbed the 'Gilded Age' bears more than a passing resemblance to our own."--Eric Foner,&nbsp;<i>The Nation</i><br><br>"Far from being a conservative, inward-looking sort who settled into soft decline, the Brahmins crisscrossed the continent and took bold risks in search of higher yields than New England's manufacturing businesses could provide. In the process, they turned Boston into an interconnected financial hub that supplied the capital that the growing West needed for development. They also remade the economy of the United States, turning it from a largely agricultural exporter into the greatest industrial country in the world, out-producing Britain, France and Germany combined... [Maggor's] research is used to present an informative chronicle and to advance a few novel, and often persuasive, hypotheses, among them the notion that America's Gilded Age isn't as uniquely American as many would think."--John Steele Gordon,&nbsp;<i>Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>"After the Civil War, heirs to the great New England fortunes aggressively shaped the political economies and institutions of their own states and those of the Western territories. Maggor overturns stereotypes of Boston elites as insulated and shows that Brahmin capitalists engaged in the rough and tumble of western expansion. In search of profitable investments, eastern capitalists helped forge the American West."--P. W. Laird,&nbsp;<i>Choice</i><br><br>"Maggor's... writing is like silk, so smooth that it... moves the reader along... &nbsp;Students of business history will benefit from a reading of this work."--David O. Whitten,&nbsp;<i>EH.Net</i>.<br><br>Brahmin Capitalism "offers a daring reassessment of late-nineteenth-century economic and political developments that addresses at once the specificity of the past and the demands of our own time for an understanding of deepening inequalities of wealth and power."--Leon Fink, <i>The Historian</i></p><h2>American Gunfight: The Plot to Kill Harry Truman--and the Shoot-out that Stopped It</h2><p>American Gunfight is the fast-paced, definitive, and breathtakingly suspenseful account of an extraordinary historical event -- the attempted assassination of President Harry Truman in 1950 by two Puerto Rican Nationalists and the bloody shoot-out in the streets of Washington, D.C., that saved the president&#39;s life.Written by Pulitzer Prize-winner Stephen Hunter, the widely admired and bestselling novelist and author of such books as Havana, Hot Springs, and Dirty White Boys, and John Bainbridge, Jr., an experienced journalist and lawyer, American Gunfight is at once a groundbreaking work of meticulous historical research and the vivid and dramatically told story of an act of terrorism that almost succeeded. They have pieced together, at last, the story of the conspiracy that nearly doomed the president and how a few good men -- ordinary guys who were willing to risk their lives in the line of duty -- stopped it.It is a book about courage -- on both sides -- and about what politics and devotion to a cause can lead men to do, and about what actually happens, second by second, when a gunfight explodes.It begins on November 1, 1950, an unseasonably hot afternoon in the sleepy capital. At 2:00 P.M. in his temporary residence at Blair House, the president of the United States takes a nap. At 2:20 P.M., two men approach Blair House from different directions. Oscar Collazo, a respected metal polisher and family man, and Griselio Torresola, an unemployed salesman, don&#39;t look dangerous, not in their new suits and hats, not in their calm, purposeful demeanor, not in their slow, unexcited approach. What the three White House policemen and one Secret Service agent cannot guess is that under each man&#39;s coat is a 9mm German automatic pistol and in each head, a dream of assassin&#39;s glory.At point-blank range, Collazo and then Torresola draw and fire and move toward the president of the United States.Hunter and Bainbridge tell the story of that November day with narrative power and careful attention to detail. They are the first to report on the inner workings of this conspiracy; they examine the forces that led the perpetrators to conceive the plot. The authors also tell the story of the men themselves, from their youth and the worlds in which they grew up to the women they loved and who loved them to the moment the gunfire erupted. Their telling commemorates heroism -- the quiet commitment to duty that in some moments of crisis sees some people through an ordeal, even at the expense of their lives.</p><p>On November 1, 1950, two Puerto Rican nationalists, Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola, nearly assassinated President Harry Truman. If this historical fact surprises you, you're not alone. <i>American Gunfight</i>, a new account by suspense novelist and Pulitzer Prize-winning film critic Stephen Hunter and journalist John Bainbridge Jr., examines this largely forgotten episode in meticulous detail, including the conspiracy surrounding it and the misconceptions associated with the would-be assassins. As the book makes clear, it's remarkable that these two men even came close to succeeding, given the disorganized nature of the plot. Intending to attack the president at the White House, they only learned in passing from a cab driver that it was being renovated and that Truman was in fact living at the nearby Blair House. When they made their assault on Blair House, they quickly lost their element of surprise when Collazo's gun misfired, leading to a 38-second shootout in front of the residence that left Torresola and one policeman dead. Meanwhile, Truman witnessed the action from an upstairs window. <p> At his ensuing trial, Collazo was depicted as a crazed fanatic, but the authors argue that this simplified assessment unnecessarily dismisses a potential political conspiracy involving Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos, who was believed by some to have masterminded the plot in an effort to bring attention to his cause. Hunter and Bainbridge provide in-depth portraits of Collazo and Torresola, as well as the Secret Service agent and three White House policemen who saved Truman's life. The descriptions of the remarkably light presidential security of the era reveal much about 1950s Washington, D.C., a time in which the president would take a daily walk around the neighborhood with just a bodyguard or two in tow. As a result of the attack, the Secret Service would forever change the way it guarded the president. This fast-paced book reads like a detective thriller, shifting quickly between various story lines and characters, including a second-by-second breakdown of the gunfight itself. The potboiler narrative may seem over the top at times, with its conjecture and imagined internal dialogue, but this comprehensive account succeeds in bringing this unlikely plot vividly to life. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i></p><b>Stephen Hunter</b> won the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Criticism as well as the 1998 American Society of Newspaper Editors Award for Distinguished Writing in Criticism for his work as film critic at <i>The Washington Post</i>.

A new historical thriller from Robert Harris.<br><br></b>Paris. 1895. On a freezing January morning, the Jewish army officer, Alfred Dreyfus, is stripped of his rank in front of a baying crowd of 20,000, and deported for life to Devil&#x2019;s Island.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Among those watching his humiliation is a high-flying intelligence officer, the clever and resourceful Georges Picquart, whose dangerous love affairs leave him wide open to blackmail.<br><br>A few months later, Picquart discovers the Germans still have a spy operating in France.

But the results are far more alarming than he ever expected, opening up a trail of corruption and deceit that leads him all the way to the highest ranks of the French army and government.<br><br>Now, in a vividly-written secret memoir kept under lock and key for more than 100 years, Picquart brings to life the Paris of the 1890s and tells the true story of a scandal that mesmerised the world.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, February 2014:</strong> A spy thriller and psychological examination, Robert Harris&#x2019;s <em>An Officer and a Spy</em> looks at the infamous Dreyfus affair through the personage of a functionary-turned-whistle-blower. It&#x2019;s Paris, 1895. A Jewish army officer, Alfred Dreyfus, has been convicted of treason and is imprisoned on Devil&#x2019;s Island; he has been publicly humiliated, bound in chains, banished to solitary confinement. But was he really a spy for Germany--or was his fate sealed because he was a Jew in an anti-Semitic time and place? Slowly, the petit bureaucrat Georges Picquart begins to suspect that Dreyfus--portrayed here mostly through heart-wrenching real-life letters he wrote from prison to his beloved family--has been scapegoated. As Picquart amasses more and more evidence about Dreyfus, he also must come to terms with some of his own behaviors and attitudes. Still, for all its delicious detail about the mores of Belle Epoque Paris, both social and political, this novel is also one for the ages, or at least for the ages in which powerful intelligence agencies, government surveillance and cover-ups are worrisomely becoming the norm. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p>ROBERT HARRIS is one of Britain's most famous writers of thriller novels and gripping historical fiction.

Jance returns with a powerful tale that explores the darkest corners of human nature.</p><p> The heat is a killer in Cochise County, Arizona, with temperatures over 100 degrees. In the suffocating stillness of an airless trailer, a woman is lying dead, a bullet hole in her chest. Why someone would murder a harmless loner with a soft spot for strays is only one of the questions nagging at the local police; another is why the killer used an eighty-five-year-old bullet, fired from the same weapon that slaughtered two other women who were discovered bound, naked, and gruesomely posed on the remote edge of a rancher&#x2032;s land. The slayings are as oppressive as the blistering heat for Sheriff Joanna Brady, who must shoulder the added double burden of a brutal re-election campaign and major developments on the home front. With more on her plate suddenly than many big city law officers have to contend with, she must put marital distractions and an opponent&#x2032;s dirty tricks in the background and deal with the terrifying reality that now threatens everyone in her jurisdiction: a serial killer in their midst. Sheriff Brady must pursue this sadistic murderer into the shadows of the past to get to the roots of a monstrous obsession and expose the permanent wounds of a crime far worse than homicide.</p></p><p><p>J. A. Jance is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of the J. P. Beaumont series, the Joanna Brady series, the Ali Reynolds series, and five interrelated thrillers about the Walker family, as well as a volume of poetry. Born in South Dakota and brought up in Bisbee, Arizona, Jance lives with her husband in Seattle, Washington, and Tucson, Arizona.</p>Is it possible that author Jance watched the darkly humorous movie FARGO before writing this? For we have a noble female sheriff with a sweetly supportive husband, small-town murders, and a tangled plot. But unlike FARGO, there is little humor. In its place we find self-righteousness and a made-for-television ending, delivered in fine fashion by reader Debra Monk. It's no fault of Monk's--as any good actor does, she makes the most of the material at hand and brings it to life. Her characterizations are strong and confident, as if she is unaware of the weak underpinnings of the story.

This title is the winner of the 2013 Costa Book Awards category for children's books, appearing in the United States for the first time. Gorgeous, intricately penned illustrations appear on almost every page, bursting with the characters' quirky personalities. The text is light, though packed with punny literary, cultural, and historical allusions. Readers with an appreciation for absurdity will devour the humorously frivolous details that abound, but those craving plot may grow fatigued by them. The narrative is quite simple; the real joys for readers here are a highly likable protagonist and the witty, exaggerated secondary character sketches. The suspense is authentic, and the sequels will surely continue to develop some of the secondary characters. A miniature book (Ishmael's memoirs) is included in a pocket on the back inside cover.

It is 1954 and Bernie is in Cuba. Tiring of his increasingly dangerous work spying on Meyer Lansky, Bernie acquires a boat and a beautiful companion and quits the island. But the US Navy has other ideas, and soon he finds himself in a place with which he is all too familiar - a prison cell. After exhaustive questioning, he is flown back to Berlin and yet another prison cell with a proposition: work for French intelligence or hang for murder. The job is simple: he is to meet and greet POWs returning to Germany and to look out for one in particular, a French war criminal and member of the French SS who has been posing as a German Wehrmacht officer. The French are anxious to catch up with this man and deal with him in their own ruthless way. But Bernie&#39;s past as a German POW in Russia is about to catch up with him - in a way he could never have foreseen. Bernie Gunther&#39;s seventh outing d</p><p>Philip Kerr has written over thirty books of which the best-known are the internationally renowned and bestselling Bernie Gunther series. The sixth book in the series, If the Dead Rise Not, won the CWA Historical Dagger.

Philip died in March 2018, days before the publication of his 13th Bernie Gunther thriller, Greeks Bearing Gifts.Starred Review. Bernie Gunther's past catches up with him in Kerr's outstanding seventh novel featuring the tough anti-Nazi Berlin PI who survived the Nazi regime (after If the Dead Rise Not). In 1954, Bernie is living quietly in Cuba, doing a little work for underworld boss Meyer Lansky, when he runs afoul of the U.S. Navy and lands in prison in Guant�namo. Later, at an army prison in New York City, FBI agents ask him about his service in WWII, in particular as a member of an SS police battalion on the Eastern Front. Another transfer sends him to Germany's Landsberg Prison, where Hitler was imprisoned in 1923. Officials from various governments question and torture him, but grimly amusing Bernie, who's smarter than any of his interrogators, successfully strings each one of them along. Vivid flashbacks chronicle Bernie's harrowing war experiences. Series aficionados and new readers alike will take comfort knowing that Kerr is hard at work on the next installment. Author tour.

It&#39;s well-organized instruction, full of detailed information on the three conditions for connecting effectively, the four communication styles, and many other ideas for improving communication with others. Though some may see the techniques as mechanical or manipulative, the audio will help many become more sensitive to other people&#39;s signals and work a little harder to connect with them effectively.

Based on the latest historical research, <i>Voices of Ancient Egypt</i> conveys a dramatic sense of everyday life in this multicultural civilization.</p><p>Kay Winters was captivated by Egypt during visits as a language arts consultant in the American International Schools in Cairo and Alexandria. This author of numerous children&#x2019;s books now lives in Quakertown, PA.<br><br>Barry Moser is an award-winning artist, illustrator, book designer and publisher. His work graces the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the British Museum collections.Grade 4-6-This book presents the voices of 13 individuals in various Old Kingdom occupations, ranging from scribe to herdsman. Winters uses first-person, free-verse poems to describe the workers' duties and places in society. Her verse is rich with informative detail: "I am a washer of clothes./Brother to the crocodile,/I spend my days in water./I soak the clothes, beat them with a wooden stave,/then wrap them around a stick/to wring out the wet." The author gives voice to the birdnetter and marshman, whom other authors neglect or lump together under headings such as "Peasants." Women are represented in the occupations of farmer, dancer, and weaver. Moser provides visual context for the selections with delicately textured watercolors. Clothing, tools, and landscapes are imagined with such faithful attention to historical detail that readers will learn as much from the illustrations as from the text. The figures, rendered in warm brown hues, embody the grace and serene strength often associated with ancient Egyptian culture. Together, text and art lend dignity to each laborer's efforts, working from the assumption that stonecutters and sailors alike took pride in their contributions to Pharaoh's kingdom. A lovely browsing title, Voices also contains valuable information for students. The historical notes and bibliography will prove especially helpful for reports.<br><i>Eve Ortega, Cypress Library, CA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Created in Darkness by Troubled Americans: The Best of McSweeney&#39;s, Humor Category</h2><p>Now more than ever, Americans are troubled by questions. As sweaty modernity thrusts itself upon us, the veil of ignorance that cloaked our nation hangs in tatters, tattered tatters. Our &#x201c;funny bones&#x201d; are neither fun nor bony. Glum is the new giddy, and the old giddy wasn&#x2019;t too giddy to begin with.<br><br>What can be done to stop this relentless march of drabbery? Not much. Nothing we can think of. It&#x2019;s pretty much too late. The light of August turns to the overcast skies of autumn, and the taunting sting of winter cannot be far ahead on the highway of the road on the horizon. Who can sing a song without words? Maybe Bobby McFerrin, but is there anyone else? Where do we go when the party is over? Perhaps the afterparty. But what comes after the afterparty?<br><br>Questions, there are so many questions, and then some queries, arriving via fax. To these we respond in the only way possible: Talk to the hand, because the face ain&#x2019;t listening. Nevertheless, we present the pages within as an offering of peace, as a message of hope, and as a perfumed hankie of love&#x2014;a hankie drizzled with the intoxicating aroma that has only one name: ha-ha-oopsie.</p><p><i>Created in Darkness by Troubled Americans: The Best of </i>McSweeney's<i>, Humor Category</i>, a collection from the clever young writers that bring us the <i>McSweeney's</i> literary journal and Web site, and co-edited by their leader, Dave Eggers, is funny from the first page. And by "first page," we mean the table contents. Of course not every essay, list, and swatch of dialogue are created equal, but the collection has many tasty morsels that are well worth a read, a read to friends, and then a re-read, after a decent interval has elapsed.<p> Most appealing in the book's starting lineup is J.M. Tyree's "On the Implausibility of the Death Star's Trash Compactor." Humorous as well as thought-provoking, this essay makes the perfect amuse bouche for what is arguably the collection's main course of hilarity, "Fire: the Next Sharp Stick?", "Candle Party," and "Unused Audio Commentary by Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky, Recorded Summer 2002, for the <i>Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring</i> DVD (Platinum Series Extended Version), Part One," all to be found in the early middle. Though a familiarity with candle parties, Howard Zinn, sharp sticks, and other topics satirized in this book is helpful, it's not necessarily required for understanding the jokes. The biggest risk here is binge-reading, as you may exchange audible laughter for the feeling that you are being force-fed an ice cream sundae. If you pace yourself--say no more than four to six pieces at a time--you should have the energy for the final third, including the funny list marathon at the end. Or save a few portions for later when you are really starving for a good laugh. <i>--Leah Weathersby</i></p><i>McSweeney&#x2019;s</i> is a small group that sells taxidermy equipment and also produces books, a literary quarterly, and <i>The Believer,</i> a monthly review.

He writes for Golf Magazine and is a commentator on NPR and ESPN. He lives in Maryland and New York.The U.S. Open is one of golf's premier tournaments, generally held at some of the most difficult private courses in the country. OPEN chronicles how and why the 2002 Open came to be played at Bethpage Black in New York and how the already challenging course was transformed into one of the hardest in the country. John Feinstein, among the nation's finest sportswriters, reads this well-edited abridgment of his book. The work describes the behind-the-scenes pre-tournament machinations and tells a more interesting story than one might expect. Feinstein's straightforward reading style demonstrates why he's a popular radio and TV commentator; he is entertaining and paces the book so that even nonenthusiasts of golf can follow the events. Although golf fans might want to hear the entire book, for most people the abridgment will suffice.

It is 2025 and the planet is rapidly approaching environmental death. Dr. Gupta Singh, a Hindu guru with a Jim Jones-like following, has proposed the suicide, by lottery, of one-third of the world's population. His followers have elected a Depopulationist majority in Congress. Led by journalist John Sinclair, a small group hopes to prove that Singh is a fraud. Singh is a formidable enemy: he cancels the medical-cosmetological treatment that the 72-year-old Sinclair (who looks 46 due to the treatment) receives, causing Sinclair to age rapidly. Singh sets the feared tax police after Sinclair, alters his records, and wipes out his wealth. Tension mounts as Sinclair stalks Singh and gains access to his "conviction"an electronic document into Singh's true identity and character. While this is less straightforward and slower to start than Warday, it is just as sobering in its tragic possibilities. Diana Hirsch, PGCMLS, Md.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.The authors of the best seller Warday ( LJ 4/1/84) depict in powerful detail a 21st-century Earth with devastated environment and rampant overpopulation. A rich and comfortable elite coexists with malnourished, pitiful billions, "the victim generation." The rich enjoy youth preservation treatments and other biomedical wonders while the rest just endure the toxicity and pollution. Hero John Sinclair and a few rich companies fight to thwart the leader of a burgeoning Depopulation Movement that would have each third person poisoned to "solve" the population crisis. Readers will follow with grim fascination these struggles to survive in a dying world. Sobering message eclipses story, and the book should strike home with a variety of informed citizens.

Memories of one of his best, most trusted friends, a tragically young victim of cancer, begin to flood through his mind as he attempts to go about the routine business of reporting a football match.</p><p> B S Johnson&#x2019;s famous &#x2018;book in a box&#x2019;, in which the chapters are presented unbound, to be read in any order the reader chooses, is one of the key works of a novelist now undergoing an enormous revival of interest. <i>The Unfortunates</i> is a book of passionate honesty and dark, courageous humour: a meditation on death and a celebration of friendship which also offers a remarkably frank self-portrait of its author.</p></p><p>BS Johson's infamous book-in-a-box is, if remembered at all, notorious for its presentation rather than its content. The "book" consists of a first and last section plus 25 other chapters, each one coming as a self-contained "pamphlet", that can be read in any order the reader likes. The subject matter concerns a journalist's day covering a football match in Nottingham, remembering previous times spent in the city with a lover now gone and a friend now dead. The innovative format permits Johnson to echo the random thought processes of his protagonist--the associations and reminiscences bubbling up in no fixed order as he walks through the city, watches and reports on the match and returns home afterwards. <p> However, it is the quality of the writing and the affecting, deeply personal narrative that should be stressed, and is so often forgotten, when discussing Johnson's most moving work. Jonathan Coe's informative introduction explains the origins of this (semi-)autobiographical work and situates it as a forerunner to hugely successful books by the likes of Ruth Picardie and John Diamond. Certainly this conveys what an emotionally engaged book <i>The Unfortunates</i> is, and is a useful rejoinder to the barely veiled negativism of the charge of being avant-garde, but it doesn't place Johnson alongside the peers with whom he should be judged. Johnson is a writer in the league of Beckett and William S Burroughs, an experimentalist but one whose humanity, and sheer skill, shine through. <i>The Unfortunates</i>, the book he wrote as a response to his friend Tony Tillinghast's death, on the back of a promise to him to "get it all down, mate," is a wonderfully honest book about friendship and loss. That it comes in a box should not blind us to the fact that as a writer Johnson was peerless and as a novel this is truly first-rate. --<i>Mark Thwaite</i></p>One of the lost masterpieces of the sixties (Jonathan Coe)</p><h2>The Elements of Typographic Style</h2><p>Renowned typographer and poet Robert Bringhurst brings clarity to the art of typography with this masterful style guide.

And neither is the fire. </p><p>When Newark councilman Windy Byers is reported missing, it launches Carter into the sordid world of urban house-flipping and Jersey-style political corruption.

A former reporter for <i>The Washington Post</i> and <i>The </i>[Newark, N.J.]<i> Star-Ledger</i>, he is now a full-time author living in Virginia, where he is at work on the next Carter Ross adventure.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>I made at least four mistakes that Monday morning, the fi rst of which was going into the office in the first place. There&#x2019;s an old saying among newspaper reporters that news never breaks in the newsroom. So if you&#x2019;re not currently working on a story, you ought to be out finding one. If you hang around the newsroom with nothing to do, you put yourself at extreme risk of be�ing&nbsp;assigned something to do by an editor. And&#x2014;ask any writer, anywhere&#x2014;editors are approximately ninety-eight percent full of&nbsp;stupid ideas. </p><p>Which leads to my second mistake: wandering by the open office door of my editor, Sal Szanto. I&#x2019;m an investigative reporter for the <i>Newark Eagle-Examiner</i>, New Jersey&#x2019;s largest newspaper. My last story had been what we in the business call BBI. Boring But Important. It was a piece about patronage hiring in a nearby county government. (My suggested headline, &#x201c;County Keeps Nepotism in the Family,&#x201d; was rejected as being too cheeky.) The thirteen people who actually bothered to read it&#x2014;the same thirteen people who read all our BBI&#x2019;s&#x2014;were very impressed. To everyone else who picked up our Sunday paper, I suspect it was merely an impediment on the way to sudoku. </p><p>Either way, it was now yesterday&#x2019;s news, making me an inves�tigative reporter momentarily lacking anything to investigate. </p><p>And so we arrive at my third mistake: not feigning deafness when Szanto croaked out my name. </p><p>&#x201c;Crrrtrrsss!&#x201d; </p><p>That&#x2019;s &#x201c;Carter Ross,&#x201d; for those who don&#x2019;t understand the peculiar dialect of my fifty- something, chain- smoking, antacid-devouring, coffee-guzzling editor. Szanto has difficulty pronounc�ing vowels when he&#x2019;s upset, stressed, or tired&#x2014;which, with the way newspapers have been going the last few years, is most of the time. It usually takes him a couple of sentences to lift his vocal cords out of the gravel and start speaking coherently. </p><p>&#x201c;Hvvsstt.&#x201d; </p><p>I took that to mean &#x201c;Have a seat.&#x201d; So I did. Szanto cleared his throat. </p><p>&#x201c;You read the fire story this morning?&#x201d; he growled. &#x201c;The thing with the two kids?&#x201d; </p><p>A fast-moving fire at about nine o&#x2019;clock the night before had swept through a house on Littleton Avenue in Newark, killing two little boys, Alonzo and Antoine Harris, ages four and six. The Newark Fire Department was offering no theories about what started it. The whereabouts of the mother, Akilah Harris, was unknown as of press time&#x2014;which did not exactly speak well of her custodial abilities. </p><p>We had given the story the usual tragedy treatment, with a large photo of the blackened house along with smaller headshots of the little boys&#x2014;smiling school portraits&#x2014;along with a story gang-written by the herd of semisupervised interns we have work�ing on the weekends. During my eight years at the paper, we had probably written variations of the story fifty times&#x2014; albeit with changed names, dates, and places&#x2014;so maybe I should be more cal�lous about it by now. But it still rips my guts out. </p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I read it,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What about it?&#x201d; </p><p>Szanto had this look on his face I couldn&#x2019;t quite place. Just like Eskimos have fifty different words for snow, Szanto has at least that many pained expressions. Parsing them takes a certain amount of expertise. The difference between &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pained because an intern just handed me a story that might as well be in Farsi&#x201d; and &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pained because I ate hot wings for lunch&#x201d; could be as subtle as a slight lowering of the lip or an extra furrowing of the brow. </p><p>In this case, it was neither. </p><p>&#x201c;Brodie wants a space heater story,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>Now it was my turn for a pained expression. Brodie is Harold Brodie, a living newspaper legend who had presided over our newsroom as executive editor for the last quarter century. Now in his late sixties, he was basically a nice man, with a high-pitched voice and eyebrows that could use some serious manscaping. He was small and fragile in a way that sort of reminded everyone of their grandfather. As a leader, he was the most benign of dictators. And, more or less, everyone loved him. </p><p>But he was still an editor, and as such he was as prone to stupid ideas as any other editor. Plus, he had this tendency to get fixated on certain subjects. </p><p>Space heaters was one of them. Like many of the nation&#x2019;s more depressed cities, Newark had its share of unimaginably hor�rid slum buildings where the heat may or may not be working&#x2014; thanks to busted boilers, pilfered pipes, or landlords who decided the best way to combat the high cost of heating oil was to abstain from buying any. </p><p>One of the ways tenants survive this injustice is to plug space heaters into their already overloaded electrical sockets and leave them on 24-7. Fire safetywise, you&#x2019;d do just as well tossing an un�supervised ten-year-old into a room with oily rags, lighter fluid, and matches. </p><p>As a result, we write about the perils of space heaters at least once every winter. The only surprise was that December and Jan�uary had been so mild we made it all the way to February without running our annual offering. </p><p>&#x201c;Did a space heater have anything to do with it?&#x201d; I asked. </p><p>&#x201c;How the hell should I know?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d; I started. </p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care,&#x201d; Szanto snapped. &#x201c;Brodie asked for a space heater story, so write him a damn space heater story. You know how he gets.&#x201d; </p><p>I did. Some editors cajoled writers into doing stories with threats or loud demands. Brodie went more for the Chinese water torture approach, drip-dropping in on you until you just gave in. Sometimes, when he approached you from behind, he jingled the change in his pocket just so you knew he was there. Most longtime <i>Eagle- Examiner</i> reporters, trained by years of Brodie jingling, stiffened reflexively when they heard nickels and quarters bang�ing together. </p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t we just reprint one of the old space heater stories?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;I seem to recall from the archives the nineteen eighty-eight space heater story was a classic&#x2014;fruity yet full-bodied, with hints of singed circuit breaker.&#x201d; </p><p>Szanto hit me with pained look No. 28&#x2014;upturned lip, creased forehead&#x2014; and I gave in. </p><p>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I huffed. &#x201c;A space heater story.&#x201d; </p><p>I went to lift myself out of the chair. </p><p>&#x201c;I want you to work with Sweet Thang,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>I sat back down. Sweet Thang was what Szanto&#x2014; and most of the other cave-dwelling editors in the building&#x2014;called our new�est intern, a honey-haired twenty-two-year-old Vanderbilt gradu�ate whose real name was Lauren Somethingorother. </p><p>Between her button nose, bright blue eyes, and a torso that rather nicely filled out a sweater set, she hadn&#x2019;t lacked for mentor�ing from some of the men in the office. </p><p>The only problem was, there was a rumor out she had gotten the job because her father and Brodie golfed together at their country club. So while working with her would improve the scen�ery, it did come with certain dangers. </p><p>&#x201c;Do I have to?&#x201d; I asked. </p><p>&#x201c;Just make her feel like she&#x2019;s doing something important, then when it comes time to write, make sure she&#x2019;s in a different county from your keyboard,&#x201d; Szanto said. </p><p>&#x201c;Fine. Whatever.&#x201d; </p><p>It was only a stupid space heater story. I could knock it off in a few hours and then move back to real journalism. As I left Szanto&#x2019;s office, I told myself it would be simple enough. </p><p>That, it turns out, was my fourth mistake. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With something short of my usual zeal, I moseyed across the newsroom and found Sweet Thang sitting in the area occupied by an ever-changing cast of interns. Newspaper economics have been so bad so long that our place, like most places, has a hiring freeze that is now old enough to enroll in the third grade. There have been buyouts, some more voluntary than others, and the threat of layoff is constant. The only people left behind are the foolish (people like me, who love the business too much to leave) and the desperate (people who can&#x2019;t find anything else and cling to the newspaper like bilge rats to drift wood). </p><p>Whenever a full- time staff member leaves, taking their high-five-figure or low-six-figure salary with them, they are replaced by an intern who is paid wages that would shame an Indonesian sweatshop. Really, they ought to do these kids a favor and tuck food stamps in with their paychecks each week. Still, the kids keep on coming to us, in ever-increasing numbers, to soak in all the valuable news- gathering &#x201c;experience&#x201d;&#x2014;read: overwork&#x2014;we provide them. </p><p>Given their low lot in life, I always go out of my way to be friendly to the interns. If nothing else, they&#x2019;re good for entertain�ment. </p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Lauren,&#x201d; I said, as I walked up to her. </p><p>She looked startled. </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, my goodness, you know my name?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;m&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re Carter Ross!&#x201d; she said, flashing a smile that surely weakened the knees of many a Vanderbilt frat boy. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re, like, the reason I wanted to come to work here. When I read your Lud�low Street story, I told my dad, &#x2018;Dad, I totally have to work at the <i>Eagle- Examiner</i>.&#x2019; Oh, my goodness. I even tweeted about your story so all my friends would know about it. And they all retweeted it. And we looked for you on Twitter, but you&#x2019;re not there, so we just tweeted round and round until we were tweeted out.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Lauren?&#x201d; I said, mostly to stop the river of words spouting from her mouth. Instead, I only diverted it. </p><p>&#x201c;You can call me &#x2018;Sweet Thang&#x2019; if you want to. I know that&#x2019;s what everyone calls me behind my back. I&#x2019;m okay with it. I mean, it&#x2019;s not, like, flattering or anything&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t <i>think</i> of myself as a Sweet Thang. I actually took courses in women&#x2019;s studies and stuff . All I&#x2019;m saying is, it&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;m going to Human Resources or anything, because it&#x2019;s like my dad told me, &#x2018;A newsroom is still a man&#x2019;s world. You have to have a tough skin.&#x2019; But then he also told me if anything got really bad, we could just tell Uncle Hal&#x2014;sorry, Mr. Brodie&#x2014; and he would take care of it. But I don&#x2019;t think being called Sweet Thang is like an insult or anything, it&#x2019;s more like&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Lauren,&#x201d; I said again. </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, sorry,&#x201d; she said, looking downward. &#x201c;I only babble when I get nervous. I&#x2019;m so sorry. I&#x2019;ll stop. Oh no, now I&#x2019;m babbling again. Okay. That&#x2019;s it. Stop.&#x201d; </p><p>She put her hand over her mouth and looked up at me. </p><p>&#x201c;Szanto wants us to work together on a story.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You and me? Together?&#x201d; </p><p>I nodded. </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, my goodness, that&#x2019;s so perfect,&#x201d; she gushed. &#x201c;Oh, my goodness, teach me <i>everything</i>. I want to learn. I want to write just like you. You&#x2019;re totally my favorite writer at the paper, you don&#x2019;t even understand. The only writer I ever liked as much as you was Judy Blume, but that was when I was nine after I read <i>Freckle Juice</i>, and it was a totally different thing. Oh, my goodness, I have to shut up. So what story are we working on?&#x201d; </p><p>The words were coming so fast it took me a second or two to realize she had, somewhere in there, formed a question I was ex�pected to answer. </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a follow-up to the fire story today,&#x201d; I said. </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, my goodness, that story was like the saddest thing ever. Can you believe those two poor little boys dying like that? I just about cried when I saw their pictures. Did you see their eyes? They were just beautiful little boys. I mean, I would have almost cried even if they were ugly. I don&#x2019;t want you to think I&#x2019;m superficial or anything. I&#x2019;m just saying&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>I held up my hand like a crossing guard halting traffic. </p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; she said. </p><p>&#x201c;Anyhow, it&#x2019;s supposed to be a story about the dangers of space heaters.&#x201d; </p><p>She tilted her head. </p><p>&#x201c;Space heaters?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What do space heaters have to do with the little boys?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;At the moment, nothing,&#x201d; I said. </p><p>&#x201c;No one from the fire department mentioned anything about space heaters.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;So how are we going to . . . ?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I snapped. &#x201c;Stop asking so many questions.&#x201d; </p><p>The bright blue gaze dropped down to the desk. The heart-melting smile vanished. Even the bouncy, honeyed hair seemed to droop. I felt like I had kicked a puppy. </p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean . . . look, it&#x2019;s just . . .&#x201d; I said, groping for the right words. &#x201c;See, sometimes, Brodie&#x2014;uhh, Uncle Hal&#x2014;he gets these ideas in his head that a story exists whether or not it actually does. But because he calls the shots around here, we sort of have to humor him.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said, considering this new information carefully, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think Uncle Hal would have us write a story that isn&#x2019;t true.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, me neither,&#x201d; I said, hoping she wouldn&#x2019;t hear the irony in my voice. </p><p>&#x201c;Cool. So what do we do now? Where do we start?&#x201d; </p><p>She looked up at me expectantly. The bright blue eyes were shining again. She plopped her elbows on top of her desk, leaned over and rested her chin in her palms, treating me to a rather un�fettered view down her scoop-necked top. </p><p>I sat down to remove myself from temptation. Had I not re�solved to maintain a perfectly professional demeanor around her, I might have enjoyed that vista. There was no denying the young lady was rather fetching&#x2014;I mean, if you like shapely twenty-two- year-old blondes, that is&#x2014; and she had a&nbsp; wholesomeness about her that put certain unwholesome thoughts in my head. As a tall, nearly broad-shouldered, thirty-two-year-old single guy with a reasonable body mass index and no facial disfigurement, I could entertain the thought she wasn&#x2019;t repulsed by me. </p><p>But while there&#x2019;s no official policy at the <i>Eagle-Examiner</i> against fraternizing with the interns, there were at least three fac�tors to consider. One, Uncle Hal might decide his paper needed one less investigative reporter if I made a play for his buddy&#x2019;s little girl. Two, I had some unresolved romantic issues with Tina Thompson, our city editor, and I suspected she would not be im�pressed if I summited Mount Intern. Three, I was getting exhausted just trying to listen to her for five minutes; an entire evening&#x2019;s worth of conversation and flirtation might make me slip into a coma. </p><p>All in all, it seemed like enough reason to leave Sweet Thang to the Sigma Alpha Epsilons. </p><p>&#x201c;Do you want me to call the fire department?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Or find a national expert on space heaters? Maybe there&#x2019;s a space heater awareness group out there? Or a space heater safety non�profit or something? I want to do this story exactly how you would do it. How would you start?&#x201d; </p><p>I was tempted to tell her I planned to start like any self- respecting reporter approached a story in which he has absolutely no interest: waste time chatting with colleagues, return several lengthy personal e-mails, take an extended lunch, check in with old sources on completely unrelated matters, then start making phone calls around three&nbsp; o&#x2019;clock when there was absolutely noth�ing better to do. </p><p>But that didn&#x2019;t seem like the kind of example I should be set�ting for an impressionable young person. </p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I like to get a feel for what I&#x2019;m writing about first. Visit the scene. Take in the sights. Talk to some neighbors. So what do you say we make a little trip out to Littleton Avenue?&#x201d; </p><p>The question was barely even formed and she was already grabbing a notebook and her car keys. </p><p>&#x201c;Can I drive?&#x201d; s...</p></p><h2>Marian Anderson: A Singer&#39;s Journey: The First Comprehensive Biography</h2><p>A definitive biography of one of America&#39;s greatest singers and a seminal figure in the American civil rights movement uncovers the life of the first AfricanAmerican soloist at the Met and the first AfricanAmerican singer to perform at the White House.</p><p>Marian Anderson is often perceived more as a civil rights legend than a singer. In this first complete biography, Allan Keiler, a music professor at Brandeis University, gives his primary allegiance to Anderson the artist. In the first decades of the 20th century, a time when black classical musicians were rare, she rose from a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia to a level of supreme accomplishment. Although she came to be identified with spirituals, she resisted being pegged as a black singer and emphasized her mastery of the European art song. <p> Virtually all of Anderson's career took place on the concert stage; opera was even harder to break into. She was in her late 50s when she became the first black singer to appear at the Metropolitan Opera. In any period, though, opera would not have suited her personality. She preferred the intimate engagement she could achieve with a song and a single accompanist.</p><p> Anderson's most indelible moment came in 1939, when the Daughters of the American Revolution refused her the use of its segregated Constitution Hall in Washington. In response, her supporters organized a huge concert at the Lincoln Memorial, an emotional event that propelled her to iconic status. But Anderson was neither outspoken nor comfortable in the political limelight. After World War II, she was criticized for not refusing to perform in the segregated South. In the last decades of her long life (she died at 96, in 1993), she was revered as a symbol of humanitarianism and restrained dignity--a quality that made her seem remote to younger, more impatient generations. </p><p> Keiler is a methodical rather than inspired writer. His prose can be flat-footed, and his chronology is often murky. But he successfully evokes what made Anderson's singing unique: the "opulent" tone and the interpretive ability that cut to the heart of a varied repertoire embracing spirituals, folk songs, and pieces by Schubert, Brahms, Handel, Sibelius, Purcell, and de Falla. And his sympathetic portrait transforms her from a civics lesson into a woman of her time, one who believed the most valuable contribution she could make to a better world was to offer it her gift. <i>--David Olivenbaum</i></p><b>Allan Keiler</b> received a Ph.D. in linguistics from Harvard University and did his graduate work in music at the University of Chicago.

He was advisor to Ken Burns&#39;s Jazz Project.These final entries in NPR's "Curious Listener's" series maintain the fresh spirit and informative stance of the first two, which address opera and popular standards. Smith, music critic for the Baltimore Sun, and Schoenberg, a tenor saxophonist and jazz educator, provide basic introductions geared to lay readers, focusing on the essentials of their respective musical genres, including a history of the form, a description of genres, brief biographies of featured composers and performers, glossaries, and recommended pieces and recordings (50 CDs for each). The charm of this series is the manner in which the authors cover the important points in their own casual yet expert tone, pointing up details along the way with intriguing sidebars (concert etiquette for classical and various historical figures for jazz) or turns of phrase while presenting thought-provoking artist or repertoire selections that will encourage spirited debate. The jazz volume suffers from a few minor editorial glitches (e.g., incorrect alphabetizing and typos), but both books are well crafted and logically organized. Smith's book is reminiscent of Michael Walsh's Who's Afraid of Classical Music? with updated scholarship and some different perspectives, while Schoenberg's complements Gene Seymour's Jazz: The Great American Art. Highly recommended for their combination of reliable information and accessible style, these are real bargains for public libraries. (Indexes not seen.) Barry Zaslow, Miami Univ.

The patterns for Magic Vine originated in the 1930&#39;s in a newspaper quilt column written by Florence LaGanke Harris. As part of a series, LaGanke presented one new pattern each week. In addition to the pattern, the reader was treated to a fictitious story about a quilt group and their leader, Nancy Page. In the group, they shared stories, and decided on what colors to use for their flowers. Twenty-two flowers are appliqued in rows with twinning vines. It is magical because of the variety of flowers that grow on the vine. The vine grows quickly, like the magic vine in Jack and the Beanstalk. Whimsical flowers and leaves are easily made, using lightweight paper backed adhesive or the quick turn method using non-woven fusible interfacing. The outside edges are finished with a variety of techniques: satin stitch, blanket stitch, blind hemstitch, and hand applique. Give Magic Vine a traditional 1930&#39;s look using reproduction fabrics or bright and contemporary with vibrant batiks. Enjoy embellishing the flowers with hand or machine stitches, beads, and crystals. Eleanor offers assistance on fabric selection and yardage and cutting charts for all five quilt sizes. Bonus projects are included. The book is conveniently bound in wire-o to lay flat.</p><p></p><h2>Chinaman&#39;s Chance</h2><p>An overweight Chinese detective is hired to find a missing woman, but becomes ensnared in a scam involving a buried fortune in Vietnam, the mafia, a rogue CIA agent, and the underworld of a corrupt town.

Veiled women hurry through the busy streets. Alcohol is outlawed, replaced by Jihad Cola, and mosques dot the skyline. New York and Washington, D.C., are nuclear wastelands. Phoenix is abandoned, Chicago the site of a civil war battle. At the edges of the empire, Islamic and Christian forces fight for control of a very different United States. <br> <br> Enormous in scope and brilliantly imagined, <i>Prayers for the Assassin</i> promises to be the powerhouse read of the year. Burning with cinematic violence, fiendish betrayal, and global intrigue, Robert Ferrigno's sensational thriller asks: What would happen to America if the terrorists won? <br> <br> After simultaneous suitcase-nuke attacks destroy New York, Washington, D.C., and Mecca -- attacks blamed on Israel -- a civil war breaks out. An uneasy truce leaves the nation divided between an Islamic republic with its capital in Seattle, and the Christian Bible Belt in the old South. In this frightening future there are still Super Bowls and Academy Awards, but calls to Muslim prayer echo in the streets and terror is everywhere. Freedom is controlled by the state, paranoia rules, and rebels plot to regain free will... <br> <br> One of the most courageous is the beautiful young historian Sarah Dougan, who uncovers shocking evidence that the nuclear attacks might not have been planned by Israel, evidence that, if true, will destabilize the nation. When Sarah suddenly goes missing, the security chief of the Islamic republic calls upon Rakkim Epps, her secret lover and a former elite warrior, to find her -- no matter what the risk. <br> <br> But as Rakkim searches for Sarah, he is tracked by Darwin, a brilliant psychopathic killer trained in the same secretive unit as Rakkim. To survive, Rakkim must become Darwin's assassin -- a most forbidding challenge. A bloody, nerve-racking chase takes them through the looking-glass world of the Islamic States of America, and culminates dramatically as Rakkim and Sarah battle to expose the truth to the entire world. <br> <br> Can the couple outrun Darwin? Who is really behind the nuke attacks? Will Sarah and Rakkim stay alive long enough to deliver the truth? Does a nation divided have a prayer? <br> <br> Robert Ferrigno's <i>Prayers for the Assassin</i> shows the novelist at the height of his powers, and delivers a masterful, unforgettable read.</p><p>Robert Ferrigno was born in South Florida, a tropical backwater rife with mosquitoes and flying cockroaches. After earning college degrees in philosophy, film-making, and creative writing, he returned to his first love, poker. He spent the next five years gambling full-time and living in a high-crime area populated by starving artists, alcoholics, thieves, and drug dealers, becoming friends with many people who would later populate his novels. Over the next several years he flew jets with the Blue Angels, drove Ferraris, and went for desert survival training with gun nuts. He ultimately gave up his day job to become a novelist, and his first book, <i>The Horse Latitudes,</i> was called &#x201c;the fiction debut of the season&#x201d; by <i>Time</i>. He lives in Washington with his family.<b>Chapter One: Twenty-five years later</b> <p> The second half of the Super Bowl began right after midday prayers. The fans in Khomeini Stadium had performed their ablutions by rote, awkwardly prostrating themselves, heels splayed, foreheads not even touching the ground. Only the security guard in the upper walkway had made his devotions with the proper respect. An older man, his face a mass of scar tissue, he had moved smoothly and precisely, fingers together, toes forward, pointing toward Mecca. The guard noticed Rakkim Epps watching him, stiffened, then spotted the Fedayeen ring on his finger and bowed, offered him a blessing, and Rakkim, who had not prayed in over three years, returned the blessing with the same sincerity. Not one in a thousand would have recognized the plain titanium band, but the guard was one of the early converts, the hard core who had risked everything and expected nothing other than Paradise in return. He wondered if the guard still thought the war had been worth it. </p><p> Rakkim looked past the guard as the faithful hurried back to their seats. Still no sign of Sarah. A few aisles over, he spotted Anthony Jr. making his way up the steps. The new orange Bedouins jacket he was wearing must have cost his father a week's salary. Anthony Sr. was too easy on him. It was always the way; the toughest cops were soft at the center. </p><p> From his vantage point, Rakkim could see domes and minarets dotting the surrounding hills, and the Space Needle lying crumpled in the distance, a military museum now. Downtown was a cluster of glass skyscrapers and residential high-rises topped with satellite dishes. To the south loomed the new Capitol, twice as large as the old one in Washington, D.C., and beside it the Grand Caliph Mosque, its blue-green mosaics gleaming. In the stands below, he saw the faithful stowing their disposable prayer rugs into the seat backs, and the Catholics pretending not to notice. He could see everything but Sarah. Another broken promise. The last chance she would get to play him for a fool. Which was just what he had told himself the last time she'd stood him up. </p><p> Thirty years old, average height, a little heavier than when he'd left the Fedayeen, but still lean and wiry. Rakkim's dark hair was cropped, his mustache and goatee trimmed, his features angular, almost Moorish, an advantage since the transition. Black skullcap. He turned up his collar against the Seattle damp, the wind off the Sound carrying the smell of dead fish from the oil spill last week. He felt the knife in his pocket, a carbon-polymer blade that wouldn't set off a metal detector, the same hard plastic in the toes of his boots. </p><p> Music blared as the cheerleaders strutted down the sidelines -- all men, of course -- knees high, swords flashing overhead. The Bedouins and the Warlords surged onto the field, and the crowd leaped up, cheering. Rakkim took one more look around for Sarah. He saw the security guard. Something had caught his attention. Rakkim followed the man's line of sight and started moving, <i>hurrying</i> now, taking the steps two at a time. He timed it perfectly, caught Anthony Jr. as he reached the deserted top level. There was an emergency exit here, a surveillance blind spot not on any of the public schematics -- the kid was a lousy thief, but knowing about the exit said something for his planning. </p><p> "What are you <i>doing,</i> Rakkim?" Anthony Jr. squirmed, a muscular teenager in a hooded sweatshirt, all elbows and wounded pride. "Don't touch me." </p><p> "Bad boy." Rakkim rapped him on the nose with the wallet the kid had lifted. Anthony Jr. hadn't even felt Rakkim take it, patting his shirt to make sure it was gone. Rakkim rapped him again, harder. "If the cops arrest you, it's your father who's disgraced. The Black Robes snatch you, you'll lose a hand." </p><p> Anthony Jr. had his father's pugnacious jaw. "I want my money." </p><p> Rakkim grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and threw him toward the exit. When Rakkim turned around, the security guard with the ruined face was already there. Rakkim held out the wallet. "The young brother found this and didn't know where to return it. Perhaps you could turn it in for him." </p><p> "I saw him find the wallet. It had fallen into a merchant's pocket." </p><p> "The young brother must have good eyes to have seen it there," said Rakkim. </p><p> The security guard's face creased with amusement, and for that instant he was handsome again. He took the wallet. "Go with God, Fedayeen." </p><p> "What other choice do we have?" Rakkim started back to his VIP box. </p><p> Anthony Colarusso Sr. didn't look up as Rakkim sat beside him. "I wondered if you were coming back." He guided yet another hot dog with everything on it into his mouth, relish and chopped onions falling into his lap. </p><p> "Somebody has to be here to Heimlich you." </p><p> Colarusso took another bite of his hot dog. He was a stocky, middle-aged detective with droopy eyes and a thunderous gut, piccalilli dripping from his hairy knuckles. The VIP sections in the stadium were reserved for local politicos, corporate sponsors, and upper-echelon military officers, with Fedayeen given preferential seating. A mere local cop, and a Catholic besides, Colarusso would never have gotten into restricted seating if he hadn't been Rakkim's guest. </p><p> The Bedouins' quarterback took the snap, backpedaling, the football cocked against his ear. He double-pumped, then let fly to his favorite receiver, a blur with hands the size of palm fronds. The pass floated against the clouds, and the receiver ran flat out, leaving his coverage behind. The ball grazed his outstretched fingertips, but he hung on, just as one of his cleats caught the turf and sent him face-first into grass. The ball dribbled free. </p><p> Boos echoed across the stadium. Rakkim looked back toward the mezzanine again. Still no sign of Sarah. He sat down. She wasn't coming. Not today, or any other day. He punched the empty seat in front of him, almost snapped it off its moorings. </p><p> "Didn't know you were such a Bedouins' fan, troop," said Colarusso. </p><p> "Yeah...they're breaking my heart." </p><p> The receiver lay crumpled on the grass as the groans of the Bedouins' fans echoed across the stadium. Rakkim even heard a few curses. A scrawny Black Robe in a nearby fundamentalist section glanced around, a deputy of the religious police with a tight black turban, his untrimmed beard a coarse bramble. The deputy shifted in his seat, robe rippling, trying to locate the offender. He reminded Rakkim of an enraged squid. The deputy's eyes narrowed at Colarusso and his mustard-stained gray suit. </p><p> "I think that eunuch's in love with you, Anthony." </p><p> Colarusso swiped at his mouth with a napkin. "Keep your voice down." </p><p> "It's a free country...isn't it, Officer?" </p><p> It still was. Most of the population was Muslim, but most of them were moderates and the even more secular moderns, counted among the faithful, but without the fervor of the fundamentalists. Though the hard-liners were a minority, their ruthless energy assured them political power far out of proportion to their numbers. Congress tried to placate them through increased budgets for mosques and religious schools, but the ayatollahs and their enforcers of public virtue, the Black Robes, were not satisfied. </p><p> The receiver slowly got up, blood pouring down his face. The stadium screen showed him coughing out a pink mist to thunderous applause. </p><p> "I remember when football helmets came with face guards," said Colarusso. </p><p> "Where's the honor in that?" said Rakkim. "A hard hit wouldn't even draw blood." </p><p> "Yeah, well...blood wasn't the point in the old days." </p><p> The deputy glared now at the moderates in the bleachers, young professionals in skirts and jeans, women and men seated together. The Black Robes had authority only over fundamentalists, but lately they had begun hectoring Catholics on the street, hurling stones at moderns for public displays of affection. Fundamentalists who left the fold were considered apostates -- they risked disfigurement or death in the rural areas, and even in the more cosmopolitan cities their families ostracized them. </p><p> The Super Bowl blimp drifted above the stadium. Emblazoned on the airship was the flag of the Islamic States of America, identical to the banner of the old regime, except for the gold crescent replacing the stars. Rakkim followed the progress of the blimp as it slowly banked in the afternoon sun. In spite of the Black Robes, the sight of the flag still brought a lump to his throat. </p><p> "Look who's here," said Colarusso, pointing to a lavish VIP box filled with national politicians and movie stars and ayatollahs. "That's your old CO, isn't it?" </p><p> General Kidd, the Fedayeen commander, saluted the network camera and the home audience. An immigrant from Somalia, he was resplendent in his plain blue dress uniform, his expression stoic. Beside him was Mullah Oxley, the head of the Black Robes, his fingers bejeweled, his robe silk, his beard a nest of oily curls. A total swank motherfucker. They made an incongruous and unsettling couple. When Rakkim had retired three years ago, General Kidd would never have sat next to Oxley, or any politician save the president. The Fedayeen were independent, answerable only to their own leadership and the needs of the nation. Three years ago anyway. </p><p> "The general looks like a real whip-cracker to me." Colarusso put down the hot dog. "On my best day, young and hung, I wouldn't have lasted five minutes in your old outfit." </p><p> The Fedayeen were the elite troops of the Islamic Republic, used mostly on small unit, covert operations against the Bible Belt. The breakaway states of the old Confederacy had a sizable arsenal of nukes, and only the balance of terror kept the two nations from all-out war. Instead there was a constant, low-level conflict of probes and feints, deadly combat without quarter or complaint. </p><p> "Best of the best," continued Colarusso. "Heck, they wouldn't even let me in the door." </p><p> "What do you want, Anthony?" </p><p> Colarusso fidgeted. "Anthony Jr. wants to apply to the Fedayeen. He's nineteen, a...</p></p><h2>Other homes and garbage: Designs for self-sufficient living</h2><p>Other homes and garbage: Designs for self-sufficient living [Paperback]</p><p></p><h2>More Than Happiness: Buddhist and Stoic Wisdom for a Sceptical Age</h2><p><br>Do you consider yourself stoical? Do a bit of meditation or mindfulness practice? Buddhism and Stoicism have a lot to offer modern readers seeking the good life, but they're also radical systems that ask much of their followers. In More than Happiness, Antonia Macaro delves into both philosophies, focusing on the elements that fit with our sceptical age, and those which have the potential to make the biggest impact on how we live. From accepting that some things are beyond our control, to monitoring our emotions for unhealthy reactions, to shedding attachment to material things, there is much, she argues, that we can take and much that we&#x2019;d do better to leave behind. <br> <br>In this synthesis of ancient wisdom, Macaro reframes the 'good life', and gets us to see the world as it really is and to question the value of the things we desire. The goal is more than happiness: living ethically and placing value on the right things in life.<br></p><p><p> Antonia Macaro is an existential psychotherapist, co-author of <i>The Shrink and the Sage</i>, and author of <i>Reason, Virtue and Psychotherapy</i>. She has many years' clinical experience in the field of addictive behaviours. Antonia has a degree in Oriental Studies and an MA in Philosophy, and was part of the UK's philosophical counselling movement from its early days. </p><p>Whether or not we agree with the Stoic assessment of what is truly good or bad, it cannot be denied that we do often make the mistake of giving too much importance to things that are of little or no value. To avoid this error, we could adopt the method Chrysippus recommended for testing appearances, which involved asking two questions:</p> <p>1. Is there good or bad at hand?</p> <p>2. Is it appropriate to react?</p> <p>You start feeling angry about someone being rude to you, for instance. You ask yourself Chrysippus' first question. For a Stoic, the answer to that would be no, because nothing external to us is truly good or bad. It then follows that the answer to the second question would also be no, it is not appropriate to react.</p> <p>Challenging our perceptions of good and bad is hard. It&#x2019;s particularly difficult to embrace the view that things like health, life and loved ones should all be indifferents, albeit 'preferred' ones. Some might find it impossible to agree that poverty is not an evil. An advantage of Chrysippus' exercise is that those who are struggling to let go of &#x2018;irrational&#x2019; ideas about good and bad can concentrate on the second question. Even if their views are still flawed, they can begin to make progress by moving away from destructive behaviours that are not conducive to virtue. But, for the Stoics, in time we should move on to confronting our incorrect views of good and bad. </p> <p>If we want to try out Chrysippus' exercise, then we must first question the value of what we&#x2019;re getting distressed, or excited, about. Sometimes we&#x2019;ll readily come to see that the issue is trivial. But even if we don&#x2019;t, we could do with examining our reactions. Often we get carried away by negative emotions that lead us to react in unskilful ways. Even if on reflection we conclude that a response is in order, it&#x2019;s best to consider calmly how to deal with the situation.</p>|<p> In practice, what does it mean to be rational? Mainly separating what really is good and bad from what merely seems good and bad. Here the Stoics' views are lofty, at odds with more ordinary perceptions of good and bad. As we have seen, all the things we are normally attracted to or repulsed by should be of no concern. Virtue alone is genuinely good mainly because it is the only reliable thing in life. Nobody can take it away, since it depends only on us. Everything else is fragile, uncertain and liable to slip through our fingers at any point. Also, unlike other things, which can be used well or badly, virtue can be only good.&nbsp;</p> <p>Epictetus put this in terms of what is up to us, or in our power, and what is not: we should cultivate the former and disregard the latter. He also urges his students to practice denying value to indifferents: </p> <p> <i>'[Begin] with the meanest and frailest things, with an earthen vessel or a cup. Afterwards, proceed to a tunic, a dog, a horse, a piece of land, and thence to yourself, your body and its parts, and your children, wife, brothers. Look around you in every direction, and hurl these things away from you. Purify your judgements. See that nothing is attached to you or cleaves to you that is not your own and may give you pain when it is torn away<i>.'</i></i></p><i><i> <p>You needn&#x2019;t go to the same extremes as Epictetus, hurling away cherished objects and loved ones. But you could practise becoming less attached to things that you know on reflection are not that important. Next time you break a mug, for instance, or spill coffee on a favourite jumper, you could try adopting Epictetus' attitude.</p></i></i></p><h2>Beautiful Crescent: A History of New Orleans</h2><p><b>Coud New Orleans have withstood the wrath of Katrina?

May God forbid the community should elect a woman only because she conspires to perpetuate its evil ways.</p> <p><i>&#x2014;The Rule of the Order of the Handmaids of St. Lucy</i></p> <p>The bell rang for Matins in the middle of a dream, as it often did. Just as she would enter deep sleep&#x2014;the scientists had a name for it, she could never recall what&#x2014;Abbess Justina of Monkbury Abbey would be awakened by the bell. This was seldom a welcome interruption, for Abbess Justina was given to pleasant dreams, more often now dreams of her childhood and young girlhood, dreams in which she would be reunited with her family.</p> <p>It was just before the hour of four a.m. in June, <i>millennium Domini</i> three.</p> <p>She rose from her narrow bed and dressed by candlelight, first sluicing cold water over her face. Long habit made short work of putting on her habit. It was a costume whose basic design had not changed much over the centuries: atop her sleep shift of unbleached muslin came a black tunic that fell to the tops of her feet, tied at the waist by a cord, and over that was worn a scapular of deep purple&#x2014;an apron of sorts that draped from the shoulders, front and back, falling to below the knees. The fabric at her wrists was smocked in a pretty diamond design halfway to the elbow, to keep the voluminous sleeves in check. For all its antique quirkiness, it was a practical garment, suitable for work and contemplation, the fabric handwoven on-site of wool from abbey sheep. On ceremonial occasions and in chapter meetings, she would carry her staff of office with its little bell as a symbol of her authority and her right to lead. Otherwise her garb was identical to that of the women in her care.</p> <p>Nothing in her costume was made of leather, not even her sandals, just as nothing in her diet came from the flesh of four-footed animals. In summer, out of doors, she wore wooden clogs. Meat was forbidden except in cases of illness, when the Rule of the Order of the Handmaids of St. Lucy allowed it for those recuperating.</p> <p>The abbess still marveled at herself, at times&#x2014;that she, such a clotheshorse in civilian life, such a devourer of women&#x2019;s style magazines, given to obsessing over the latest hair products and adornments, had adapted so readily to the habit. Coco Chanel would probably have said the classics never go out of style.</p> <p>Well, it was difficult to say what Coco might have made of the clogs.</p> <p>Now Abbess Justina&#x2019;s hair was cut straight across the nape; every few months or so she would wield the scissors herself, chopping away without the aid of a mirror. She wrapped her shorn head tightly in a linen coif, pinned at the crown, a bit like Katharine Hepburn&#x2019;s in <i>A Lion in Winter</i>. Over that was draped a black veil, held in place by a narrow woven circlet meant to represent a crown of thorns. She tied a linen wimple like a baby&#x2019;s bib around her neck. Pinning the coif and attaching the veil took some minutes, the pins stubborn in her swollen fingers. The headgear was worn back from the forehead to allow half an inch of hair to frame the face, the single concession the order had made to modernity. In medieval times a wide starched headband would have sat atop the coif fitted so tightly around face and neck. Truth be told, in those days the headdress might have been adorned with pearls and gemstones, for the nuns of yore had on occasion had a little trouble keeping to their vows of poverty, not to mention chastity and obedience.</p> <p>Abbess Iris, who had ruled just before Justina, had been the one to decide on the need for a change of habit, modifying the traditional style. The color of the scapular was the major innovation&#x2014;the deep blue-purple of the iris, as it happened. Of course it all had to be done with the bishop&#x2019;s approval. The poor man had been absolutely flummoxed at having to pronounce on women&#x2019;s fashion. He was shown several sketches, like a magazine editor being presented with the new fall line, and vaguely pronounced any of them suitable. The deep purple he thought a slightly racy departure from the centuries of black but he did not demur.</p> <p>Dear Abbess Iris. A flamboyant but wise character. Now long gone and buried in the cemetery of Monkbury Abbey.</p> <p>Pity, thought Abbess Justina, she&#x2019;d done away with the style that covered much of the head, for it would have hidden the gray hair and jowly neckline that had come as one of the booby prizes of late middle age. But at least the coif and veil still prevented one from looking like a Persian cat as the gray hair gained its ruthless hold, like kudzu. If they&#x2019;d had to change anything, she thought they might have shortened the skirt length, for she still had strong, shapely legs, the product of a youth spent climbing the Welsh mountains like a billy goat. Nun or no nun, one liked to present a pleasing and vigorous appearance to the world.</p> <p>Following timeless ritual, Abbess Justina reverently kissed a large wooden cross before draping it round her neck to lie flat against her chest. Around her shoulders she now buttoned a hooded mantle. In choir she would pull the hood over her head, for warmth, and for privacy. It also was wonderful for hiding the expression. A strategic bend of the neck and tuck of the chin and one could be as private as a turtle pulling in its head. These little things, these momentary escapes into solitude, were what made living in a community possible.</p> <p>Learning how to put all this on without the use of a mirror was one of the biggest challenges of the life. She had yet to see a novice who didn&#x2019;t need extra time in the morning to get all the bits and bobs attached in the right order.</p> <p>That and mastering the Great Silence. And learning to loosen family ties. And any other number of things that made people wonder why they bothered, these crazy women who chose to live in the middle of nowhere, working and singing and praying. There was no answer to that, but the single-word answer that could be given was Joy. We do it for Joy.</p> <p>Sometimes she caught a glimpse of herself in the plate-glass window in the kitchen: she liked taking a turn at kitchen duty now and again, even though she was exempt from chores because of her position. It kept her humble. It also gave her access to the thrum of what was really going on in the convent. Interplays and tensions and little personality conflicts that could grow into internecine warfare if not closely watched. Lately there had been undercurrents, of that she was certain. They seemed to date to the time of the earthquake, she thought, registering the irony. That had been a year ago, almost to the day, and measuring just over five on the Richter scale, it had rocked the abbey from side to side in the most terrifying way. For who in England was used to earthquakes?</p> <p>But the &#x201c;emotional&#x201d; undercurrents seemed to be connected with the appointment of the new cellaress, an unpopular choice in some quarters, she knew. The sisters had formed an attachment to Dame Meredith in that role, but of course there was no question of her being able in her weakened condition to carry on that heavy responsibility. And of course forming attachments of any sort had to be discouraged. </p> <p>There was also some tension surrounding the new novice, although whether she was the cause or the result wasn&#x2019;t clear. She was not adjusting well to the religious life, which was never a completely easy transition for anyone. Post-traumatic stress disorder they called it now. PTSD. And no wonder, given Sister Rose&#x2019;s history. The new postulant, as well&#x2014;Abbess Justina had serious reservations about the new postulant, Mary Benton. Vocations were so rare nowadays. She supposed it was possible they had, unwittingly, lowered the standards somewhat, allowing Mary to sneak past.</p> <p>Still, what was clear was this: There was great change afoot at Monkbury Abbey. What was uncertain in Abbess Justina&#x2019;s mind was whether all that change would prove to be for the good.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by G. M.

In Southern Italy, she was a loose woman who had murdered someone. Immigrating to America with three children, she lost one along the way. Helene&#x2019;s youthful obsession with Vita deepened as she grew up, eventually propelling the journalist to Italy, where, with her own children in tow, she pursued the story, determined to set the record straight.</p><p>Finding answers would take Helene ten years and numerous trips to Basilicata, the rural "instep" of Italy&#x2019;s boot&#x2014;a mountainous land rife with criminals, superstitions, old-world customs, and desperate poverty. Though false leads sent her down blind alleys, Helene&#x2019;s dogged search, aided by a few lucky&#x2014;even miraculous&#x2014;breaks and a group of colorful local characters, led her to the truth. </p><p>Yes, the family tales she&#x2019;d heard were true: There had been a murder in Helene&#x2019;s family, a killing that roiled 1870s Italy. But the identities of the killer and victim weren&#x2019;t who she thought they were. In revisiting events that happened more than a century before, Helene came to another stunning realization&#x2014;she wasn&#x2019;t who she thought she was, either.</p><p>Weaving Helene&#x2019;s own story of discovery with the tragic tale of Vita&#x2019;s life, <em>Murder in Matera</em> is a literary whodunit and a moving tale of self-discovery that brings into focus a long ago tragedy in a little-known region remarkable for its stunning sunny beauty and dark buried secrets.</p></p><p><p>From the age of four, Helene Stapinski heard lurid yet inspiring tales about her great-great-grandmother Vita, a loose woman back in Southern Italy who fled to America in 1892 with her three children after committing murder.

It&#x2019;s an undiscovered land filled with badlands-like hills, ancient caves, and fertile valleys with silver-tinged olive trees, whose isolation is matched only by its forlorn, incredible beauty. In a stunning turn of events, Helene comes to learn what really happened, sparking an upheaval of her own identity and sense of history. Deeply researched and reported, <em>Murder in Matera</em> is a remarkable true story about one family&#x2019;s hidden secrets. It is also a powerful and timeless story of immigration and motherhood&#x2014;a profound testament to how far one woman would go in search of a better life in America, not only for herself, but for her children and the preservation of her family.</p><p>Helene Stapinski is the author of <em>Five-Finger Discount: A Crooked Family History, </em>which recounts her family&#x2019;s criminal history, and <em>Baby Plays Around: A Love Affair, with Music,</em> which chronicles her years playing drums in a rock band in Manhattan.

Rare is the poet or novelist who comes away from that Italian city uninspired (even those who may not have enjoyed a room with a view during their visit). Accurately described as a "deeply personal and learned labor of love," this volume is literary historian Lewis's erudite paean to Florentine charms. Lewis, most noted for his highly regarded biography of Edith Wharton (1975), skillfully interweaves his personal associations with the city, which began during military service in World War II, with those of more celebrated visitors over the centuries. A generous portion of history is added. Lewis has a vast store of knowledge about many subjects but never sounds pedantic; he assumes that his readers are also knowledgeable. For those who aren't, or who have never been to Florence, his book may demand too much concentration and commitment. Public and academic libraries with earlier, similar works on the city (e.g., Mary McCarthy's The Stones of Florence, 1959, and, more recently, Christopher Hibbert's Florence: The Biography of a City, Norton, 1993) may consider Lewis's an optional purchase.

Their experiences in Florence come alive in his descriptions of the places they have rented, their friends, their explorations and their reflections. The author also shows off the city with quotes from Henry James, T.S. Eliot, the Brownings, Bocaccio, Dante and other writers and artists who have been similarly touched by its ambience. While he was working on the book, Lewis informs us, "even a simple bus ride into the center carries me past strong historical and personal associations... [that] we know we have seen before...

Interstellar war erupts and Jaibriol is snatched away to be the unwilling ruler of the Highton Aristos. Sauscony must lead an invading space fleet to rescue him from his own Empire-without revealing that they are married. With much of interstellar civilization poised on the brink of destruction, it is the devotion of these two lovers, their sacrifices, and their heroism, that might just forge a new order.<br></p><p>Sauscony of Skolia and Jaibriol of the Highton Aristos are truly star-crossed lovers: They are the heirs to interstellar empires that are implacable, age-old enemies. When they seek to save their secret relationship in an exile disguised as death, they disturb the delicate balance of power among Skolia, Aristo, and Earth. Interstellar war erupts, empires rise and fall, and it looks as though the Highton Aristos may recover first, with their dark lust for conquest intact. <p> <i>The Radiant Seas</i> follows the critically acclaimed novels <i>Primary Inversion</i>, <i>Catch the Lightning</i> (the 1997 Sapphire Award winner), and <i>The Last Hawk</i> as the fourth of a proposed seven novels in the Saga of the Skolian Empire, an exceptionally well-written and well-plotted series that mixes space opera, future history, hard SF, military SF, and romance. By internal chronology, <i>The Radiant Seas</i> is the direct sequel to <i>Primary Inversion</i>. It is also Catherine Asaro's most ambitious novel to date. Fans of the earlier books will find <i>The Radiant Seas</i> less focused on romantic aspects, and readers new to the series may find this novel starts slow, but the complex story is always clear and soon picks up speed. Hard SF fans will revel in the numerous brilliant ideas extrapolated from physics and genetics (the author is a physicist), while readers uninterested in science will find the novel unmarred by chunky speculative-science digressions. All will find <i>The Radiant Seas</i> bursting with fascinating characters and subplots, and will quickly discover they can't put the novel down. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>Catherine Asaro was born in Oakland, California and grew up in El Cerrito, just north of Berkeley.

Rookmaaker&#39;s enduring analysis looks at modern art in a broad historical, social, and philosophical context, laying bare the despair and nihilism that pervade our era. He also shows the role Christian artists can play in proclaiming truth through their work. Rookmaaker&#39;s brilliant articulation of faith and scholarship is insightful and inspiring. The book moves freely and with a sense of urgency between the worlds of high culture, popular art and music, and Christian faith. This reissue makes his foundational work available to a new generation.</p><p><p><strong>H. R. ROOKMAAKER </strong>(1922&#x2013;1977) grew up in the Dutch East Indies. As a young man in wartime Holland, he was interned for distributing anti-Nazi leaflets and became a Christian during that time. In 1948 a lifelong friendship with Francis Schaeffer began. In 1959 Rookmaaker published his doctoral thesis on the artist Gauguin, and in 1965 he was invited to the Chair of Art History at the Free University of Amsterdam. Rookmaaker was also highly respected as a jazz critic.</p></p><h2>The Feud</h2><p>Berger chronicles small-town America of the 1930s in his narrative of the feud between the Beelers of Hornbeck and the Bullards of Milville.

Featuring more than 125 of his favorite dishes, this book is an indispensable compilation of the simple, sumptuous recipes from Puck&#x2019;s world-renowned repertoire.<br><br><b>Live, Love, Eat! </b>contains recipes for appetizers such as Puck&#x2019;s acclaimed Crab Cakes with Sweet Red Bell Pepper Sauce; a variety of seasonal soups and salads, including his famed Chinois Chicken Salad; and, along with innovative pasta and risotto recipes, the California-style pizzas that first made Puck and his original Spago Hollywood a favorite of international celebrities. Puck also serves up all manner of main courses, including seafood recipes such as Lobster Imperial in Black Bean Sauce; poultry dishes such as Pan-Roasted Chicken Breasts Stuffed with Bell Peppers with Sweet Green Onion Sauce; and meat recipes such as Wolfgang&#x2019;s Bacon-Wrapped Meat Loaf and Rack of Pork with Caramelized Maple Onions.

The Best of Wolfgang Puck</i>. In 150 of his favorite recipes Wolfgang Puck demonstrates why and how flavorful food and fun can't be separated from each other--certainly not in his kitchen.<p>Consider the ubiquitous guacamole recipe. Puck calls his version California Guacamole. His ingredients are few, the flavors marshaling around roasted whole garlic, which adds to the whole an underlying sweet and mellow deliciousness. It's an act of elevation and restoration for one of the grand treats of the Southwest. Puck is a master of the respectful tweaking of familiar recipes and ingredients in favor of rejuvenation and flavor. The lowly chicken comes to mind. Chicken pot pie becomes Chicken Pot Pie Soup, Puck replacing the traditional crust with delicate dumplings. With Spicy Chicken Pizza (the chicken is marinated in lime juice, olive oil, garlic, cilantro, and minced jalape�o chilies) Puck takes this Neapolitan standard on a side trip to Mexico. Viener Backhendl, Austrian fried chicken, meets Asia by way of panko, Japanese-style bread crumbs. And so on.</p><p><i>Live, Love, Eat!</i> has chapters devoted to appetizers, soups, salads, pizza and pasta, seafood, poultry, meat, accompaniments, and desserts. This is a richly illustrated book showing what results look like and how they get there. A final chapter, "Basics," is worth the price of admission. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>Wolfgang Puck is chef and owner of a number of celebrated restaurants, including Spago restaurants in the Los Angeles area, Chinois in Santa Monica, Postrio in San Francisco and Las Vegas, and Granita in Malibu.

They focus on the second century. During that period there was much in the practice and teaching of the church that corresponds to what is found in the New Testament, and during that time many new features developed which were to be characteristic of the later history of the church. Some later material which bears on the second century or which serves to complete the account of a development is brought into these studies. Some New Testament texts bearing on the topic are listed at the beginning of each chapter. There is, thus, a stress on historical continuity. We are talking about the same community of people, the same church, as existed in the New Testament. We are tracing out some features of its historical development through the second century. - From the Introduction</p><p>Dr. Everett Ferguson is Professor of Church History Emeritus at Abilene Christian University.

While bearing names denoting snake or dragon, these Serpents of Wisdom oversaw the construction of magnificent civilisations within which they and their descendants served as the priest kings and as the enlightened heads of mystery school traditions. This book recounts the history of these &#39;Serpents&#39; and why they are returning now.</p><p>"The Return of the Serpents of Wisdom is an extraordinary synthesis of esoteric wisdom, and it contains some information that is highly secret. This book triggers inner memory and awakens initiatic consciousness." - Barbara Hand Clow, author of The Pleidean Agenda <p> "The Return of the Serpents of Wisdom is a magnificent accomplishment...To my knowledge this is the first time anyone has pulled together the history, mythology and spiritual lineages of the serpent masters.

But her richly human portrait, so respectful of the complexities of her subject&#39;s life, seems unlikely to be surpassed. Lee extricates Virginia Woolf (1882-1941) from clich�s about madness and modernism to reveal a vigorous artist whose work is politically probing as well as psychologically delicate. She makes brilliant use of the formidable Woolf archives to let the writer speak directly to us, then comments shrewdly on her words&#39; hidden significances. Biographies don&#39;t get much better than this.While Virginia Woolf -- one of our century's most brilliant and mercurial writers -- has had no shortage of biographers, none has seemed as naturally suited to the task as Hermione Lee. Subscribing to Virginia Woolf's own belief in the fluidity and elusiveness of identity, Lee comes at her subject from a multitude of perspectives, producing a richly layered portrait of the writer and the woman that leaves all of her complexities and contradictions intact. Such issues as sexual abuse, mental illness, and suicide are brought into balance with the immensity of her literary achievement, her heroic commitment to her work, her generosity and wit, and her sanity and strength.<p>It is not often that biography offers the satisfactions of great fiction -- but this is clearly what Hermione Lee has achieved. Accessible, intelligent, and deeply pleasurable to read, her Virginia Woolf will undoubtedly take its place as the standard biography for years to come.</p></p><h2>Natural Progesterone: The Multiple Roles of A Remarkable Hormone</h2><p>This book describes the nature of progesterone hormone and its physiological functions.

Naipaul was born in Trinidad in 1932. He came to England on a scholarship in 1950. He spent four years at University College, Oxford, and began to write, in London, in 1954. He pursued no other profession.<br> &nbsp;<br> His novels include <i>A House for Mr Biswas</i>, <i>The Mimic Men</i>, <i>Guerrillas</i>, <i>A Bend in the River</i>, and <i>The Enigma of Arrival</i>. In 1971 he was awarded the Booker Prize for <i>In a Free State</i>. His works of nonfiction, equally acclaimed, include <i>Among the Believers</i>, <i>Beyond Belief</i>, <i>The Masque of Africa</i>, and a trio of books about India: <i>An Area of Darkness</i>, <i>India: A Wounded Civilization</i> and <i>India: A Million Mutinies Now</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> In 1990, V.S. Naipaul received a knighthood for services to literature; in 1993, he was the first recipient of the David Cohen British Literature Prize. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2001. He lived with his wife Nadira and cat Augustus in Wiltshire, and died in 2018.&#39;The edgy exactitude of Naipaul&#39;s writing is both effortlessly classical and yet at the same time brilliantly contemporary, as sharp and lucid as a spear of glass... He is inimitable, truly great and truly deserving of the Nobel&#39; Observer</p><h2>The Colonel&#39;s Wife: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>A bold, dark-hued novel by a writer who &#x201c;conjures beauty from the ugliest of things&#x201d; (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>)</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>In the final twilit moments of her life, an elderly woman looks back on her years in the thrall of fascism and Nazism. Both her authoritarian tendencies and her ecstatic engagement with the natural world are vividly and terrifyingly evoked in <i>The Colonel&#x2019;s Wife</i>, an astonishing and brave novel that resonates painfully with our own strained political moment.</p><p>At once complex and hideous, sexually liberated and sympathetic to the darkest of political movements, the narrator describes her childhood as the daughter of a member of the right-wing Finnish Whites before World War II, and the way she became involved with and eventually married the Colonel, who was thirty years her senior. During the war, he came and went as they fraternized with the Nazi elite and retreated together into the deepest northern wilds. As both the marriage and the war turn increasingly dark and destructive, Rosa Liksom renders a complex and unsavory character in a prose style that is striking in its paradoxical beauty. <i>The Colonel&#x2019;s Wife</i> is both a brilliant portrayal of an individual psychology and a stark warning about the perils of nationalism.</p></p><p><b>Rosa Liksom</b> was born in a village of eight houses in Lapland, Finland, where her parents were reindeer breeders and farmers. She spent her youth traveling Europe, living as a squatter and in communes.

Just to <em>look at</em> all the mountains and canyons and desert horizons can take weeks of driving and hiking. And to get acquainted with the independent, self-contained, slightly quirky people who call this place home ...well, that can take a lifetime. James Evans understands that. Recalling his decision to make the Big Bend his artistic muse and photographic subject, he says, "I moved here in 1988 to dedicate my life to the Big Bend and its people. I don't shoot pictures and leave and make a book. This work is a slow accumulation of years of being here. The mountains are familiar friends and the people my heroes. I am one of them."</p><p>In this book, James Evans records the landscapes and the people of the Big Bend in all their beauty, harshness, and character. Images such as "South Rim with Agave," "Eyes of the Chisos," and "The Road to Candelaria" capture the distances, openness, and rough loveliness that draw people to this remote part of the Texas-Mexico border. Evans's photographs of people&#x2014;legendary ranchwoman Hallie Stillwell, Kickapoo girls at a ceremonial dance, national park superintendent Ross Maxwell, school boys in Boquillas, Mexico, to mention only a few&#x2014;show a deeply felt, but anti-sentimental understanding of his Big Bend neighbors. Other images, such as "Snake and Jesus," "Drug Blimp," and "Rope-O-Matic" reveal the whimsical, offbeat sensibility that sets Evans apart from others who have photographed the Big Bend.</p><p>Also included are equally distinctive "Notes and Stories," in which Evans talks about how he came to photograph each particular person and each place and what they mean to him. Robert Draper's foreword pinpoints why Evans's work has such irresistible appeal. In his words, "The photographs of James Evans celebrate the unburnished beauty of Big Bend country as a way of celebrating the free spirit. I see no way out of voicing the clich�: this is a deeply life-affirming collection."</p></p><p>James Evans of Marathon, Texas, has been photographing the landscape and people of the Big Bend since 1988. His work has appeared in many national magazines and is in collections at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin, the Beaumont Museum of Art, the Art Museum of South Texas, the El Paso Museum of Art, and the Southwestern Writers Collection at Southwest Texas State University, as well as in many private collections.&#34;Resisting the temptation of melon-hued sunsets, Evans works with documentary-style black-and-white photography. The landscapes he captures are not simply blas�, wide-angle homages to the hallowed frontier: they reveal Big Bend&#39;s quirks and bemused attitudes, suggesting the hitherto blasphemous--namely, that the American West can have a sense of humor, and at times be downright weird. Above all, Evans is exposing beauty from its proper angles. To see Big Bend through his eyes is to gaze upon an altogether alien world, and in so doing, to feel our innocence reawaken.&#34; (Robert Draper)</p><h2>Addy: An American Girl/Boxed Set (American Girl Collection)</h2><p>This boxed set contains one of each of the Addy paperback titles: Meet Addy, Addy Learns a Lesson, Addy&#39;s Surprise, Happy Birthday, Addy!, Addy Saves the Day, and Changes for Addy.</p><p>This keepsake boxed set features all six of Addy&#39;s beautifully illustrated books, filled with her inspiring stories about growing up in 1864.

The author of this rediscovered classic asserts that life's direction is a self-fulfilling prophecy, and his advice is practical,&nbsp;rather than philosophical. This approach advocates the purposeful application of creative thought and willpower as the sure-fire way to achieve goals.</p><p>This classic Wallace D. Wattles title has often been compared to Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, and many believe they act as excellent companion titles. Individuals who have read books by Robert Allen, Suze Orman or David Bach will find often find this title to as well be of interest.The man who owns all he wants for the living of all the life he is capable of living is rich; and no man who has not plenty of money can have all he wants. Life has advanced so far, and become so complex, that even the most ordinary man or woman requires a great amount of wealth in order to live in a manner that even approaches completeness. Every person naturally wants to become all that they are capable of becoming; this desire to realize innate possibilities is inherent in human nature; we cannot help wanting to be all that we can be. Success in life is becoming what you want to be; you can become what you want to be only by making use of things, and you can have the free use of things only as you become rich enough to buy them. To understand the science of getting rich is therefore the most essential of all knowledge. <p>In writing this book I have sacrificed all other considerations to plainness and simplicity of style, so that all might understand. The plan of action laid down herein was deduced from the conclusions of philosophy; it has been thoroughly tested, and bears the supreme test of practical experiment; it works.

Clark:<br> <br> "That pictures can express truth more succinctly than words is proved here in the images of Dorothea Lange and the other photographers who documented the Japanese American relocation of World War II. The wistful, forlorn look of the children; the hopeless, dejected expression of their elders; the Nisei Grill that soon will be 'under new management'; the foreboding sign declaring that all one's possessions must be sold; the white storekeeper's sneering words 'We don't want any Japs back here EVER!'; the concentration camps; the armed sentries; the deportation lines&#x2014;each is a powerful reminder of a nightmare that was acted out in our land of the free, all as the result of racism and wartime hysteria...."<br> <br> Published by The MIT Press for the California Historical Society.</p><p>The days following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor were dark days of the American spirit. Unable to strike back effectively against the Japanese Empire, Americans in the Western states lashed out at fellow citizens and resident aliens of Japanese ancestry. <p>Executive Order 9066, signed by President Roosevelt on February 19, 1942, was the instrument that allowed military commanders to designate areas "from which any or all persons may be excluded." Under this order all Japanese and Americans of Japanese ancestry were removed from Western coastal regions to guarded camps in the interior. Former Supreme Court Justice Tom C. Clark, who represented the Department of Justice in the "relocation", writes in the Epilogue to this book: </p><p>The truth is--as this deplorable experience proves--that constitutions and laws are not sufficient of themselves. . .Despite the unequivocal language of the Constitution of the United States that the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, and despite the Fifth Amendment's command that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, both of these constitutional safeguards were denied by military action under Executive Order 9066. . .</p>Excerpt from "The Japanese in California" by Donald Pike and Roger Olmsted <p>Even as the internees lived behind barbed wire, an ironic footnote was being written by young Japanese American men in Europe and the Pacific. Japanese American soldiers served hazardous duty with specialized units like Merrill's Marauders, while others, serving as interpreters, provided probably the most important link in American Intelligence. The 442nd Combat Team, an all-Japanese American unit fighting in Italy and France, emerged with more casualties and more decorations than any other unit of comparable size and length of service in the Army's history. In all, more than 25,000 Japanese Americans served--and many died--in the armed forces during the war. </p><p>But the tragedy of the relocation was more than squalid internment camps, lost property, and sons dead and maimed. Japanese Americans suffered the psychological stress of confinement, the embarrassment and humiliation of being regarded as traitors to their country, and the inescapable fear that their ancestry rather than their actions would always determine how they would be treated. The relocation confronted other Americans with the fact that they had paid only lip service to a cherished tradition of equality and constitutional protection--and left them with a shame that no amount of rationalization or studied indifference could diminish.</p></p><h2>Good Boy, Fergus!</h2><p>Childrens Book</p><p></p><h2>Men Made New</h2><p>Book has some wear from usage and age, but there are no rips or tears on the pages</p><p></p><h2>H. L. Mencken: Prejudices: The Complete Series: A Library of America Boxed Set</h2><p>Few writers roiled the American cultural scene like Henry Louis Mencken. Pathbreaking journalist, trenchant social observer, and unbridled humorist, Mencken was the most provocative and influential cultural critic of the last century. To read him today is to be plunged into an era whose culture wars were easily as ferocious as our own, in the company of a writer of boundless curiosity and vivacious frankness. In the six volumes of <i>Prejudices</i> published between 1919 and 1927, Mencken attacked what he felt to be American provincialism and hypocrisy, and championed writers and thinkers he saw as harbingers of a new candor and maturity. Laced with savage humor and delighting in verbal play, Mencken's prose remains a one-of-a-kind roller coaster ride over a staggering range of thematic territory: literature and journalism, politics and religion, sex and marriage, food and drink, music and painting, the absurdities of Prohibition and the dismal state of American higher education, and the relative merits of Baltimore and New York. Now, The Library of America restores the full text of Mencken's landmark work to print in a deluxe two- volume boxed set, ensuring that new generations of readers can rediscover his one-of-a-kind genius.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

But during a stop in Los Angeles, one of the human scientists traveling with the Tosoks is gruesomely murdered, and all evidence points to the alien Hask. The Los Angeles Police Department is determined to indict Hask for the crime, even though the aliens have little concept of laws or crime as we understand them. The only thing the U.S. government can do is secretly procure the services of Dale Rice, a leading civil rights lawyer, and hope he can clear Hask of the charges.

Most entered the town on the very wide road known as Broadway. Past the dogwood trees that had just begun to display their pink-and-white splendor up and down Granville's main streets; past the stately houses where women and children stood in their yards to watch the reputed troublemakers, as if the ragtag troops from some distant army had invaded the town; and past the dozens of strangers from neighboring towns leaning against buildings and hitching posts, malingering and scheming, drinking and waiting. Many had never ventured farther than twenty-five miles from home, and now, in dedication to the cause they risked their lives to advance, they had traveled a hundred miles and more to this seemingly peaceful and innocent town. </p><p> Nestled among the ridges, spurs, and hollows of the hills rising above Raccoon Creek, the middle fork of the Licking River, Granville was situated at nearly the center of the state of Ohio: hence the choice of the town for this meeting of delegates from all parts of the state. By the spring of 1836, Granville was largely an antislavery town surrounded by small, intense enclaves of proslavery zealots. It was the home of two schools, the Granville Literary and Theological Institution for men, and, for women, the Granville Female Seminary. And there were several safe houses for fugitives, well known among those who worked in the underground movement. Passions had been aroused the year before, in both the academic and residential communities, when Theodore Weld passed through Granville on his statewide tour. Speaking for three nights in a row, he barbed the conscience of the town as he dodged a steady stream of rotten eggs. One of the nights, he spoke near an open window and was repeatedly covered with eggs. Each time, he would wipe the slush from his face and clothing and barely miss a beat. </p><p> Granville's roster of antislavery advocates expanded after Weld's tour, but most of the peace-loving citizens of this quiet village considered themselves to be antiabolitionists and wanted nothing to do with what they believed to be a fanatical movement. Although they did not condone slavery -- and, indeed, considered themselves antislavers -- they also did not know how to end it. Many favored gradual emancipation, and many more were advocates of colonization. And so, in November 1835, during the very same days when Rankin, Campbell, Gilliland, and others in Ripley were discussing how to shape their convictions into the context of a constitution for their new antislavery society, another group of men with a different set of values was meeting in Granville. </p><p> There, at the Methodist church, twenty-six leaders of the community, all considered men of conscience as well as property, discussed what they could do to discourage the now-imminent invasion of their town by hundreds of abolitionists. They compiled nine resolutions. And after reassuring each other that they ardently believed in freedom of speech, they wrote: "We consider discussions [that] from their nature tend to inflame the public mind -- to introduce discord and contention into neighborhoods, churches, and literary institutions, and put in jeopardy the lives and property of our fellow citizens -- to be at varience with all rules of moral duty and every suggestion of humanity." Although they condemned slavery as a menacing evil, they were critical of the abolitionists for scaring slaveholders into strengthening their opposition to emancipation. The measures of the abolitionists, they said, dangerously "strengthen and rivet the chains of the slaves and perpetuate their bondage." </p><p> Worse still, they agreed, the abolitionists should not use strident language such as "man stealers," nor should they suggest that Negroes could be educated and one day achieve a place of equality. Such beliefs were "utterly vain and delusive." </p><p> They praised the efforts of the American Colonization Society and approved its plans to transport free blacks from the U.S. to Africa, saying that "the unwillingness of the blacks of this country to emigrate to Africa is one of the strongest evidences of that degradation and imbecility which naturally results from their condition while resident among the whites." And on March 31, 1836, the <i>Gazette</i> of Newark, Ohio, published a proclamation signed by the mayor, village clerk, council members, and sixty-nine other citizens of Granville urging against the upcoming abolition convention. </p><p> By the morning of April 27, men from the towns and hamlets around Granville began to gather in the taverns, back alleys, and tree-lined streets of the town while the big barn north of town owned by Ashley Bancroft and dubbed by the abolitionists as the "Hall of Freedom" was coming alive with the spirit and sounds of solidarity. That the energy and passions of both groups would eventually collide seemed inevitable. </p><p> It was after the townsfolk had rejected all requests for space for the meeting that Bancroft, a thirty-seven-year-old carpenter and one of the leading abolitionists in the region, volunteered his barn, and even built a temporary addition to accommodate the expected masses. The barn was outside the jurisdiction of the mayor and village council, which meant that the delegates meeting there were not entitled to the privilege of police protection on their way to the assemblage, during it, or after it. Still, the delegation of so-called fanatics filed through the big double doors and side doors of the barn, one after another, tipping hats, shaking hands, putting faces to names. They came by the dozens, from as far as Cincinnati and Toledo, as close as Alexandria and Columbus. There were now 120 antislavery societies in Ohio, with the largest having a roster of 942 members in the town of Paint Valley, in Ross County, near Cleveland. The total enrollment of the state societies by the spring of 1836 was approximately ten thousand, out of a population of roughly 1.2 million people. </p><p> The list of delegates -- most, if not all, active in the Underground Railroad in their regions -- included: James Birney, the abolitionist editor and close friend of Rankin's who, on January 1, had issued the first edition of his new antislavery newspaper, <i>The Philanthropist,</i> out of New Richmond, Ohio, near Ripley; Rankin; John Isaac Mahan; Dr. Beck; Asa Mahan, formerly a Lane board member and now the president of Oberlin College; twenty-five others from that college and the town of Oberlin, including Lane Rebels Amos Dresser, Augustus Wattles, and James A. Thome; two students from the Granville Literary and Theological Institution who had become notorious for their oratorical speeches against slavery; and nineteen women, some of whom were students from the local women's academy and some delegates from antislavery societies. </p><p> On the first day of the convention, April 27, the delegates crowded the barn, finding space to sit in the hay mows, on high ladders, even on the rafters. More than one hundred spectators entered the barn, carefully watched by men assigned to guard the delegates, standing sentry at the doors of free speech and free assembly. For security, Bancroft placed a big chain across the large gate at the head of the trail leading to the barn from the road; this would require all members of the mob gathering in town to climb the fence, slowing them down and thus preventing a surprise attack on the barn. Others brought dozens of hoop poles from a local cooper's shop. By cutting each one in half, the group had an ample supply of sturdy cudgels, if necessary for self-defense. The poles were piled in a corner of the barn for all to see, and to serve as a reminder that the threat of interruptions and antiabolitionist violence was ever present. </p><p> The day commenced with a resolution from Birney "that in order to perpetuate our free institutions the subject of slavery ought to be fully discussed by the non-slaveholding states." James A. Thome delivered a speech titled "Appeal to the Females of Ohio" in which he beseeched women to stand equally with men in fighting for the rights of the oppressed and to break away from "that odious sentiment" that can shape a woman into nothing more than "a painted puppet or a gilded butterfly." James Dickey, who worked the underground with Rankin out of Greenfield, Ohio, proposed several resolutions, all of which passed. </p><p> The next morning began with the election of officers for the coming year. Alexander Campbell and James Gilliland were voted in as vice presidents; John B. Mahan and John Rankin were appointed the society's managers for Brown County. Birney and two other delegates recommended that $5,000 be raised over the next year, and as $10, $20, and $50 bills passed over heads in the crowd to the platform where Birney stood, a cry for more, for a goal of $10,000, replaced the $5,000 figure. Within minutes, the crowd raised $4,500. After the amount was announced, hundreds of men and women sang until the timbers shook, "Praise God from whom all blessings flow." </p><p> A series of resolutions followed. Then Rankin walked up the three steps to the wooden platform at the center of the barn. A light must have kindled in the depths of his eyes as he looked out onto the throng of hundreds of people united in a cause far larger than themselves. His speech focused on the obligation of the church to take a stand against slavery and began with a denunciation of every Biblical justification for slavery. From Exodus to Deuteronomy to James, he explained, the so-called slaves, which Southern-sympathizers and slaveholders were constantly noting in the Bible, were, in truth, servants. And the difference between slaves and servants was that the natural rights of servants are protected by law, whereas slaves have no such rights to be protected. The servitude in Israel was similar to apprenticeships in America, he said. It was voluntary; the servants were paid for their services; they could be held for no longer than their term of co...</p></p><h2>Robert E.

It's no real pleasure in life.</i> -The Misfit, in Flannery O'Connor's "A Good Man Is Hard to Find"</p><p> In his dashing (if sometimes depressive) antebellum prime, he may have been the most beautiful person in America, a sort of precursor-cross between England's Cary Grant and Virginia's Randolph Scott. He was in his element gossiping with belles about their beaux at balls. In theaters of grinding, hellish human carnage he kept a pet hen for company. He had tiny feet that he loved his children to tickle. None of these things seems to fit, for if ever there was a grave American icon, it is Robert Edward Lee-hero of the Confederacy in the American Civil War, a unifying national figure for a century or so thereafter, and currently a symbol of nobility to some, of slavery to others.</p><p> After Lee's death in 1870, Frederick Douglass, the former fugitive slave who had become the nation's most prominent African American, wrote, "We can scarcely take up a newspaper...that is not filled with nauseating flatteries" of Lee, from which "it would seem...that the soldier who kills the most men in battle, even in a bad cause, is the greatest Christian, and entitled to the highest place in heaven." Two years later one of Lee's ex-generals, Jubal A. Early, apotheosized his late commander as follows: "Our beloved Chief stands, like some lofty column which rears its head among the highest, in grandeur, simple, pure and sublime."</p><p> In 1907 President Theodore Roosevelt expressed mainstream American sentiment in a letter to the Committee of Arrangement for the Celebration of the Hundredth Anniversary of Lee's birth: <i>General Lee has left us the memory, not merely of his extraordinary skill as a General, his dauntless courage and high leadership... but also of that serene greatness of soul characteristic of those who most readily recognize the obligations of civic duty....He stood that hardest of all strains, the strain of bearing himself well through the gray evening of failure; and therefore out of what seemed failure he helped to build the wonderful and mighty triumph of our national life, in which all his countrymen, north and south, share.</i></p><p> Teddy Roosevelt, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, and President Harry S. Truman had at least three things in common with Lee: They were all brave soldiers, staunch leaders of men, and, in no pejorative sense, mama's boys. Both Truman and MacArthur were adjured by their strong-minded mothers to grow up just like Robert E. Lee, and they never stopped taking that charge to heart.</p><p> When a white mob tried to prevent the integration of public schools in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957, Robert Penn Warren wrote, "Can the man howling in the mob imagine General R. E. Lee, CSA, shaking hands with Orval Faubus, governor of Arkansas?" Certainly not-Lee was too fine. But at the turn of the twenty-first century, a portrait of Lee on the James River floodwall in Richmond, Virginia, was defaced, restored, denounced by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and defended by white supremacist David Duke. U.S. Attorney General-designate John Ashcroft was widely disparaged for having called Lee a "patriot." "We've got to stand up and speak in this respect," Ashcroft had written, "or else we'll be taught that [Lee and other Confederate leaders] were giving their lives, subscribing their sacred fortunes and their honor to some perverted agenda."</p><p> One thing that can be said for Lee is that he would have welcomed none of these pronouncements. If the self-effacing patrician could have known that his face would live on for so long as a quasi-religious, recurrently divisive symbol, it might have made him moan, as he did after sending thousands of men to be cut to ribbons at Gettysburg, "Too bad! Too bad! OH! TOO BAD!" He was one of the few great men of whom it can be said that his sense of honor was rooted in genuine-if in fact far from simple or serene-humility. The most sublime word, Lee said, was "duty." In 1860 he wrote to Robert E. Lee Jr., who was starting college:</p><p> <i>You must be frank in the world, frankness is the child of honesty and courage. Say just what you mean to do on every occasion, and take it for granted you mean to do right....Never do anything wrong to make a friend or keep one; the man who requires you to do so, is dearly purchased at a sacrifice. Deal kindly, but firmly with all your classmates; you will find it the policy which wears best. Above all do not appear to others what you are not.</i></p><p> Did he speak in such tones to himself? He was the last avatar, wrote Edmund Wilson approvingly, of "classical antique virtue, at once aristocratic and republican." But he was also a man. And isn't it true, as Montgomery Clift said in the role of Robert E. Lee Prewitt in From Here to Eternity, "Ain't nothin the matter with a soldier that ain't the matter with everybody else"?</p><p> We may think we know Lee because we have a mental image: gray. Not only the uniform, the mythic horse, the hair and beard, but the resignation with which he accepted dreary burdens that offered "neither pleasure nor advantage": in particular, the Confederacy, a cause of which he took a dim view until he went to war for it. He did not see right and wrong in tones of gray, and yet his moralizing could generate a fog, as in a letter from the front to his invalid wife: "You must endeavour to enjoy the pleasure of doing good. That is all that makes life valuable." All right. But then he adds: "When I measure my own by that standard I am filled with confusion and despair."</p><p> His own hand probably never drew human blood nor fired a shot in anger, and his only Civil War wound was a faint scratch on the cheek from a sharpshooter's bullet, but many thousands of men died quite horribly in battles where he was the dominant-fiery-spirit, and most of the casualties were on the other side. If we take as a given Lee's granitic conviction that everything is God's will, however, he was born to lose.</p><p> He was usually kinder than most great men. But in even the most sympathetic versions of his life story he comes across as a bit of a stick-certainly compared with his scruffy nemesis, Ulysses S. Grant; his zany, ferocious "right arm," Stonewall Jackson; and the dashing "eyes" of his army, Jeb Stuart. For these men, the Civil War was just the ticket. Lee, however, has come down in history as too fine for the bloodbath of 1861-65. As an icon he has enabled Americans of the South and also of the North to feel that somehow the American family was too decent to have brought upon itself four years of domestic carnage. To efface the squalor and horror of the war we have the image of Abraham Lincoln freeing the slaves, and we have the image of Robert E. Lee nobly putting down his sword and standing selflessly for reconciliation. Both of those images have undergone reassessment-for many contemporary Americans, Lee is at best the moral equivalent of Hitler's brilliant field marshal Erwin Rommel (who, however, turned against Hitler, as Lee never did against Jefferson Davis, who, to be sure, was no Hitler)-but they haven't gone away.</p><p> Can we recast Lee in terms more edifying in this century?</p><p> One problem is that Lee's life didn't fit him. He appears to have been too fine for his childhood, for his education, for his profession, for his marriage, and for the Confederacy. Not according to him. According to him, he was not fine enough. For all his audacity on the battlefield, he accepted rather passively one raw deal after another, bending over backward for everyone from Jefferson Davis to James McNeill Whistler's mother.</p><p> By what can we know him? The works of a general are battles, campaigns, and usually memoirs. The engagements of the Civil War shape up more as bloody muddles than as commanders' chess games. For a long time during the war "Old Bobbie Lee," as he was referred to worshipfully by his troops and nervously by the foe, had the greatly superior Union forces spooked, but a century and a third of analysis and counteranalysis has resulted in no core consensus as to the genius or the folly of his generalship. And he wrote no memoir. He wrote personal letters-a discordant mix of flirtation, joshing, lyrical touches, and stern religious adjuration-and he wrote official dispatches that are so impersonal and (generally) unself-serving as to seem above the fray. He also wrote one strange parable, which had come to him in a dream.</p><p> Grant finally wore down Lee's ingenious military defenses, but he didn't crack his facade: There at the end stood Lee at Appomattox, too fine to represent defeat. In 1959, two years after citing Lee as a touchstone, Robert Penn Warren-who had written a biography of John Brown and a novel whose central character was inspired by Huey Long-grumbled, "Who cares about Robert E. Lee? Now, there's a man who's smooth as an egg. Turn him around, this primordial perfection: you see, he has no story. You can't just say what a wonderful man he was, and that you know he had some chaotic something inside because he's human but you can't get at it."</p><p> Maybe in this century, after monumentalism has given way to chaos theory and obsession with the self, we can at last figure out how to care humanly about the self that Robert E. Lee was at such pains to deny. The only way to get inside him, perhaps, is by edging fractally around the record of his life to find spots where he comes through; by holding up next to him some of the fully realized characters-Grant, Jackson, Stuart, his father (Light-Horse Harry Lee), John Brown-with whom he interacted; and by subjecting to contemporary skepticism certain concepts-honor, "gradual emancipation," divine will-upon which he unreflectively founded his identity.</p><p> Then there are minor but provocative matters like his feet, a peculiar instance of misspelling, his pet hen, his enigmatic "Pussyism" joke. For all that he tends to bring out a certain solemnity, even in discussions of his humor, he was capable of larky jocularity in the oddest connections and the darkest of times. If in considering his sad life we strive for too consistent a tone, we miss some of its jangly resonance. As he would say to his children when he was at his most intimate with them, "No tickling, no story."</p><p> He wasn't always gray. Until war aged him dramatically his sharp dark brown eyes were complemented by black hair ("ebon and abundant," as his doting biographer Douglas Southall Freeman puts it, "with a wave that a woman might have envied"), a robust black mustache, a strong full mouth and chin unobscured by any beard, and dark mercurial brows. He was not one to hide his looks under a bushel. His heart, on the other hand..."The heart, he kept locked away," as Stephen Vincent BenTt proclaimed in John Brown's Body, "from all the picklocks of biographers." Accounts by people who knew him give the impression that no one knew his whole heart, even before it was broken by the war. Perhaps it broke many years before the war. "You know she is like her papa, always wanting something," he wrote about one of his daughters. The great Southern diarist of his day, Mary Chesnut, tells us that when a lady teased him about his ambitions, "[h]e remonstrated-said his tastes were of the simplest. He only wanted a Virginia farm-no end of cream and fresh butter-and fried chicken. Not one fried chicken or two-but unlimited fried chicken." Just before Lee's surrender at Appomattox, one of his nephews found him in the field, "very grave and tired," carrying around a fried chicken leg wrapped in a piece of bread, which a Virginia countrywoman had pressed upon him but for which he couldn't muster any hunger.</p><p> In 1960 Robert Penn Warren was trying, unsuccessfully, to write an essay about Lee's decision to side with the Confederacy. "I do hope you can manage [it]," Warren's friend Cleanth Brooks wrote to him. Brooks was a fellow Southerner and a prime mover along with Warren in the so-called New Criticism, which concentrated on literature's intrinsic texture rather than its political and biographical ramifications, and he seemed to want Lee's texture to be enough. "You are right: that shouldn't fall into the wrong hands," Brooks went on. "I don't want to see a Lee throwing in his lot with the Confederacy because of an Oedipus complex, for instance." Well, why not? What is so fine about Lee that he is exempt from whatever sifter a given age may employ to sort out personality? It is too late for Freud now, but not for psychologizing. Item: A recent study found boys brought up in "mother-only households" to be disproportionately at risk for major depressive disorders. (See Appendix I.)</p><p> A boy who grows up with no father but one who is absent and discredited may lack certain tones of voice, may develop alternative modes of authority. Of the precious few memories Robert E. Lee can have had of his prodigal father coming home, the most vivid, we may assume, was of a broken, grotesquely swollen figure hobbling up the front walk, head swathed in bandages. A mob of patriots, as they saw themselves, had beaten Henry "Light-Horse Harry" Lee, hero of the Revolution, very nearly to death. They had jabbed him with pocketknives and dripped candle wax into his eyes in attempts to make sure he was dead. They had slashed his face wide open in trying to cut off his nose. He had been defending a newspaper's right to oppose a war.</p><p> It was 1812. Robert was five years old.</p><p> On his father's side, Lee's family was among Virginia's and therefore the nation's most distinguished. Four of his father's cousins had been prominent members of the Continental Congress-so prominent, indeed, that other first families expressed resentment that the Lees were hogging the Revolution.</p><p> Henry, the scion who was to become Light-Horse Harry, was born in 1756. As a young a man he was always cheerful, ever gallant toward the ladies, a hell of a fellow among the fellows, given to flights of wild and biting humor, fiercely opinionated, and able to quote Alexander Pope at length from memory. He graduated from Princeton at nineteen, joined the Continental Army at twenty as a captain of dragoons, and impressed Gen. Charles Lee, no very direct relation, as having "come out of his mother's womb a soldier."</p><p> Though physically rather slight and facially rather plump, Harry looked fine on a horse and rode like the cavalier he was by birth. As he rose in rank and independence to command Lee's light cavalry and then Lee's legion of cavalry and infantry, he held the intense loyalty of his troops by combining strict discipline, bold stratagems, constant readiness to ride, and prudent preparation, including attention to hygiene: "I never saw one of his men in the general hospital," said an army surgeon. Every one of his cavalrymen eventually carried a sword taken personally from an enemy. When one of his men went over to the British, Harry captured him, hanged him, beheaded him, and proudly sent the head and neck with the rope still around it to his commander and hero, George Washington, who, however, was appalled.</p><p> Primarily Harry was no major-engagement man but a gadfly, a leader of freelance forays against superior f...</p></p><h2>Secret Historian: The Life and Times of Samuel Steward, Professor, Tattoo Artist, and Sexual Renegade</h2><p><p>Drawn from the secret, never-before-seen diaries, journals, and sexual records of the novelist, poet, and university professor Samuel M. Steward, <i>Secret Historian </i>is a sensational reconstruction of one of the more extraordinary hidden lives of the twentieth century. An intimate friend of Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, and Thornton Wilder, Steward maintained a secret sex life from childhood on, and documented these experiences in brilliantly vivid (and often very funny) detail.</p><p>After leaving the world of academe to become Phil Sparrow, a tattoo artist on Chicago's notorious South State Street, Steward worked closely with Alfred Kinsey on his landmark sex research. During the early 1960s, Steward changed his name and identity once again, this time to write exceptionally literate, upbeat pro-homosexual pornography under the name of Phil Andros.</p><p>Until today he has been known only as Phil Sparrow&#x2015;but an extraordinary archive of his papers, lost since his death in 1993, has provided Justin Spring with the material for an exceptionally compassionate and brilliantly illuminating life-and-times biography. More than merely the story of one remarkable man, <i>Secret Historian </i>is a moving portrait of homosexual life long before Stonewall and gay liberation.<br><i>Secret Historian </i>is a 2010 National Book Award Finalist for Nonfiction.</p></p><p><p>Justin Spring is a writer specializing in twentieth-century American art and culture, and the author of many monographs, catalogs, museum publications, and books, including <i>Fairfield Porter: A Life in Art </i>and <i>Paul Cadmus: The Male Nude</i>.</p>1<br>&#x201c;Wild&#x2014;Hog Wild&#x201d;Samuel Morris Steward was born July 23, 1909, in Woodsfield, the seat of Monroe County in southeastern Ohio, a county bordering on Appalachia, and in many ways just as impoverished as that region. His modest, small-town beginnings are important to an understanding of the man he later became, for his plainspoken humor and openness to all things sexual are surely related to his country roots. At the same time, his lifelong preoccupation with the nature of his homosexuality can be seen as a direct response to the &#x201c;stern and austere Puritanism of my Methodist maiden aunts.&#x201d;Outside accounts of Steward&#x2019;s early life are basically nonexistent, and he himself wrote of it only in passing; those few sentimental memories he retained of his childhood&#x2014;whether shared in letters to his sister, or else recounted in his journals or unpublished memoirs&#x2014;seem to have made him too sad to dwell on it for long. And indeed he had a painful early life. His academically brilliant mother had died of an intestinal obstruction when he was only six, and his father, who had both drug and alcohol addictions, was essentially unable to care for either Steward or his baby sister. As a result, Steward grew up in a boardinghouse run by his mother&#x2019;s sister and two stepsisters. These three older spinsters&#x2014;Elizabeth Rose and Minnie Rose, and their half sister Amy Morris&#x2014;spent most of their day &#x201c;cooking and serving, making beds and washing, and hoeing in the garden behind the house when there was time for it.&#x201d;The Morris, Rose, and Steward families had resided in the Woods-field area for generations, and were well established in the professional class; even Steward&#x2019;s father, despite his drinking and drug problems, had served for a time as Monroe County&#x2019;s deputy auditor, and despite his multiple addictions taught a weekly Methodist Bible class for more than twenty years. Steward&#x2019;s paternal grandfather, meanwhile, was a respected country doctor. All of Steward&#x2019;s family on his deceased mother&#x2019;s side were teetotalers as well as devout Methodists, and the church literally loomed large in their lives, for the town&#x2019;s imposing redbrick church stood just across the street from the boardinghouse. The town had no Catholics, and the one black who had attempted to settle there had been run out of town on a rail. As a result, Steward grew up seeing the world as basically divided between those who devoted their lives to Protestant churchgoing and Christian good works (such as his aunts and maternal grandparents), and those who had, for whatever reason, fallen away.Faced both with the death of his mother and the improvidential absence of his father, the six-year-old Steward might well have withdrawn into grief or shocked stupor. But with the resilience of a child, he did just the opposite, dedicating himself energetically to becoming a highly sympathetic companion to the work-worn aunts who had taken him in. By stepping away from his own feelings and concerning himself primarily with the management and care of others, he was insuring he would not once again be discarded, and in so doing he was also setting the pattern for his later life. But as a result he also grew up feeling very much an outsider, and relatively at a distance from his own feelings and impulses, for he naturally had a great deal of grief and sadness about his own life situation. His aunts seemed not to notice, however, for they had any number of problems and concerns of their own, and moreover they themselves were not very happy people. Worn down by endless amounts of domestic work and by constant money worries, they seem to have lavished most of the joy and attention they had on Steward&#x2019;s very beautiful baby sister. Steward was after all a boy, and seemed relatively capable of taking care of himself. None of the three aunts had much understanding of males: after all, none of them had married or had children or even had brothers. As adult women living in a home owned by aged parents, their own lives were, in a very real sense, a surrender to womanly duty: their personal frustrations and domestic claustrophobia were something they accepted as their lot. These were the three adults who populated Steward&#x2019;s childhood&#x2014;stern, comfortless, deeply religious women who could not quite understand him or his ways, and yet whom he felt an urgent, almost desperate need to comfort, accommodate, and appease.Out of the double loss of his mother and father&#x2014;one loss permanent and abrupt, the other ongoing and perpetually inconclusive&#x2014;Steward seems to have accepted from a very early moment that his life&#x2019;s essential condition would be one of loneliness and exclusion. Deprived of parental love and recognition, he would grow up expecting very little love from others. Likewise, having experienced very little touching, warmth, or affection as a child, he would eventually find that prolonged physical intimacy made him extremely uncomfortable, and that those who expected the same from him were destined for disappointment. He would grow up to be a very sociable man, highly skilled at managing and seducing others, but unable to cope with everyday closeness. As a boy, he did his best to fit in, but at the same time he spent a good deal of time by himself. His preference for solitude eventually led this gifted young boy to develop a rich private fantasy life, one in which he thought of himself as someone special, separate, and apart.Steward was very intelligent, like his mother, and he worked very hard in school. His aunts had high expectations for him, for although they were stuck in the boardinghouse, they wanted something better for him, and also for his sister. They saw to it that he earned top grades, kept fastidiously clean, had perfect manners, and in general did everything right. Wanting so much to please and amuse his aunts, Steward not only worked hard at his studies but also quickly mastered the piano, and soon specialized in &#x201c;showy little pieces&#x201d; that he picked out specifically to delight them. They, in turn, made a great fuss about his looks, which were delicate and refined. In an early set of photographs, he is beautifully turned out in a Little Lord Fauntleroy suit featuring velvet breeches, a matching jacket, and a delicate round white collar. In many ways, he seemed like a perfect little doll.Whatever ambivalence Steward may have felt about his childhood in later life, he never denied the goodness of his aunts, or their love of him, or the many great sacrifices they made on his behalf. And, in fact, he would portray them quite tenderly in his first literary novel. But he was also exhausted by them&#x2014;for the perfect, doll-like, self-contained little man they so much wanted him to be was very far from the complicated, fallible, and emotionally deprived young boy that he was, or the troubled teen he eventually became.Because of his extraordinary academic achievements, Steward seems to have felt from a very early moment that the great awareness of &#x201c;difference&#x201d; he had from the people around him was primarily due to his intelligence. And indeed he was very intelligent: brilliant not only at all his school subjects, but also at music, amateur dramatics, and drawing. Among these many activities, though, he found his greatest pleasure in reading and writing, for through them he began to imagine himself in the outside world. From his earliest days Steward read everything he could lay his hands on: popular fiction, poetry, and the great classics of Western literature. He borrowed vast numbers of books from the local library, and also purchased books and magazines by mail. Because silent films were shown weekly in town, Steward became a great fan of film and stage celebrities&#x2014;men and women whose lives and careers seemed so real to him in the pages of Photoplay that he began to write them letters. Much to his amazement, several wrote back. In this way, reading and writing served from earliest childhood to create for Steward an intimate conduit to the world of his dreams and fantasies&#x2014;a world full of glamorous and fascinating people so very different from the simple folk of Woodsfield. Before long Steward was writing to nearly every celebrity he could think of&#x2014;authors, musicians, and film stars&#x2014;and assiduously collecting and cataloging their autographs and letters. He cherished their responses to him as proof positive of his own special ness. Through his collection of celebrity letters and autographs, he had created a world in which he stood at the absolute center.In his unpublished memoirs, Steward makes clear that while he spent many of his leisure hours reading and writing and chasing down autographs, he also spent a good deal of time playing with other boys and girls. He may have been thought of by his contemporaries as &#x201c;different&#x201d; because of his bookishness, but he was always treated with respect. The facility with which he handled nearly everyone around him&#x2014;from his aunts to his teachers to his fellow high school students&#x2014;suggests that Steward had a talent for communication. He was by no means a leader, but by the time he reached high school (and the emotional and physical changes that come with the onset of puberty), he was well known for playing any number of sly pranks and practical jokes. Duplicity was something in which, for whatever reason, he took an enormous and childlike delight: being bad, misbehaving, and &#x201c;crossing the line&#x201d; between acceptable and unacceptable behavior were in many ways central to his character from boyhood onward. This love of duplicity became even stronger when Steward discovered sex.Growing up under the watchful eyes of spinsters, Steward had known that sex was &#x201c;wrong&#x201d; long before he knew what it was. He later remembered, only half jokingly, that &#x201c;in my sheltered little-boy Methodist way, the talk [of sex] caused me much agony.

But an unsettling meeting with the venerated Zen teacher D. T. Suzuki, combined with the sudden need to accept a dreary position teaching the philosophy of religion, forced the young academician to look more closely at the religious ideas he had once thought dead. Within traditional religious texts the scholar discovered a core of esoteric and philosophical ideas, more mature and challenging than anything he had ever associated with Judaism, Christianity, and the religions of the East.<br><br> At the same time, Needleman came to realize?as he shares with the reader?that ideas and words are not enough. Ideas and words, no matter how profound, cannot prevent hatred, arrogance, and ultimate despair, and cannot prevent our individual lives from descending into violence and illusion. And with this insight, Needleman begins to open the reader to a new kind of understanding: The inner realization that in order to lead the lives we were intended for, the very nature of human experience must change, including the very structure of our perception and indeed the very structure of our minds.<br><br> In <i>What Is God?</i>, Needleman draws us closer to the meaning and nature of this needed change?and shows how our present confusion about the purpose of religion and the concept of God reflects a widespread psychological starvation for this specific quality of thought and experience. In rich and varied detail, the book describes this inner experience?and how almost all of us, atheists and ?believers? alike, actually have been visited by it, but without understanding what it means and why the intentional cultivation of this quality of experience is necessary for the fullness of our existence.<br><br></p><p>The acclaimed author of <i>The American Soul</i>, <i>Why Can&#x2019;t We Be Good?</i> and <i>Money and the Meaning of Life</i>, Jacob Needleman is Professor of Philosophy at San Francisco State University, and former Director of the Center for the Study of New Religions at the Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley.

Coming of age as a writer and comedian during the Sixties and Seventies, Eric stumbled into the crossroads of the cultural revolution and found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of George Harrison, David Bowie and Robin Williams, all of whom became lifelong friends. With anecdotes sprinkled throughout involving Mike Nichols, Mick Jagger, Steve Martin, Paul Simon and many more, as well as the Pythons themselves, Eric captures a time of tremendous creative output with equal parts hilarity and heart.In Always Look on the Bright Side of Life, named after the song he wrote for Life of Brian which has since become the number-one song played at funerals in the UK, he shares the highlights of his life and career with the kind of offbeat humor that has delighted his audiences for five decades. This is a memoir chock-full of behind the scenes stories from a high-flying life featuring everyone from Princess Leia to Queen Elizabeth.</p><p>Eric Idle is a comedian, actor, author and singer-songwriter who found immediate fame on television with the sketch-comedy show Monty Python&#39;s Flying Circus. Following its success, the Pythons began making films that include Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Monty Python&#39;s Life of Brian (1979) and The Meaning of Life (1983). Eric also wrote the award-winning musical Spamalot. He lives in Los Angeles.</p><h2>Chorus Skating</h2><p>The discovery of errant living notes escaped from an extradimensional symphony leads Spellsinger Jon-Tom and his otter sidekick, Mudge, on a perilous quest to rescue some spoiled princesses, battle a guerrilla gorilla, and match wits with an evil alien band</p><p>Born in New York City in 1946, Foster was raised in Los Angeles. After receiving a Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Political Science and a Master of Fine Arts in Cinema from UCLA (1968, l969) he spent two years as a copywriter for a small Studio City, Calif. advertising and public relations firm. His writing career began when August Derleth bought a long Lovecraftian letter of Foster&#39;s in 1968 and much to Foster&#39;s surprise, published it as a short story in Derleth&#39;s bi-annual magazine The Arkham Collector. Sales of short fiction to other magazines followed. His first attempt at a novel, The Tar-Aiym Krang, was bought by Betty Ballantine and published by Ballantine Books in 1972. It incorporates a number of suggestions from famed SF editor John W. Campbell. Since then, Foster&#39;s sometimes humorous, occasionally poignant, but always entertaining short fiction has appeared in all the major SF magazines as well as in original anthologies and several &#34;Best of the Year&#34; compendiums. Six collections of his short form work have been published. Foster&#39;s work to date includes excursions into hard science-fiction, fantasy, horror, detective, western, historical, and contemporary fiction. He has also written numerous non-fiction articles on film, science, and scuba diving, as well as having produced the novel versions of many films, including such well-known productions as Star Wars, the first three Alien films, and Alien Nation. Other works include scripts for talking records, radio, computer games, and the story for the first Star Trek movie. In addition to publication in English, his work has appeared and won awards throughout the world. His novel Cyber Way won the Southwest Book Award for Fiction in 1990, the first work of science-fiction ever to do so. Though restricted (for now) to the exploration of one world, Foster&#39;s love of the far-away and exotic has led him to travel extensively. After graduating from college he lived for a summer with the family of a Tahitian policeman and camped out in French Polynesia. He and his wife JoAnn Oxley, of Moran, Texas, have traveled to Europe and throughout Asia and the Pacific in addition to exploring the back roads of Tanzania and Kenya. Foster has camped out in the &#34;Green Hell&#34; region of the Southeastern Peruvian jungle, photographing army ants and pan-frying piranha (lots of small bones; tastes a lot like trout); has ridden forty-foot whale sharks in the remote waters off Western Australia, and was one of three people on the first commercial air flight into Northern Australia&#39;s Bungle Bungle National Park. He has rappelled into New Mexico&#39;s fabled Lechugilla Cave, white-water rafted the length of the Zambezi&#39;s Batoka Gorge, driven solo the length and breadth of Namibia, crossed the Andes by car , sifted the sands of unexplored archeological sites in Peru, gone swimming with giant otters in Brazil, and surveyed remote Papua New Guinea and West Papua both above and below the water. His filmed footage of Great White Sharks feeding off South Australia has appeared on both American television and the BBC. Besides traveling he enjoys listening to both classical music and heavy metal. Other pastimes include basketball, hiking, body surfing, scuba diving, collecting animation on video, and weightlifting. He studied karate with Aaron and Chuck Norris before Norris decided to give up teaching for acting. He has taught screenwriting, literature, and film history at UCLA and Los Angeles City College as well as having lectured at universities and conferences around the country and in Europe. A member of the Science-Fiction Writers of America, the Author&#39;s Guild of America, and the Writer&#39;s Guild of America, west, he also spent two years serving on the Planning and Zoning Commission of his home town of Prescott, Arizona. Foster&#39;s correspondence and manuscripts are in the Special Collection of the Hayden Library of Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona.

While focusing on the goal of developing the creativity and self-expression inherent in each individual, the approach is unique in that there are no step-by-step instructions.</p><p>Rolina van Vliet is a painter and a teacher of abstract art at a variety of centers for artistic training. She regularly exhibits her work, which varies from abstract expressionism to lyrical abstract painting, and is the author of &#34;Painting Abstracts.&#34;I am a big fan of Rolina van Vliet&#39;s work and her books. This book is very similar to the one published by Search Press in 2008, but I do feel it is worth buying both. The book concentrates on creativity and self-expression and features many beautiful works of art by Rolina. It explains abstract painting methods in detail and will enable you to produce your own paintings. Short study exercises and professional tips provide a short-cut to creativity.-KarenPlatt.co.uk Rolina van Vliet has produced an excellent book on how to analyse the abstract method and ways to produce lively and effective abstract art. Many people feel that abstract art is simply unstructured and free flowing but Rolina shows that in fact there are some very in depth thought processes in its creation. Rolina begins by welcoming the reader to a world of free expression and says that by following this route ones artistic expressions will be given the scope they need to create spontaneous lively works that emanate from within oneself. This book has developed to show the artist how to familiarise themselves with abstract painting an easy to understand way and that will subsequently point the way to the great adventure of creating one&#39;s own expressive, original and creative works. Rolina describes this book as being an answer to some of the students questions such as what is abstract ?A&#34; where do I begin ?A&#34; The text in her book gives information about the background, goal and procedure of the abstract method, and how to use these to develop the focus of your own talents in these areas. These are accompanied by illustrations that clarify the content of the methods described. The text next to the illustrations gives extra information such as technique, composition and construction of the works. These help put into context the application of methods to the individual artworks. There are useful study exercises and tips for the student to work from to help focus on the bringing out the creativity from within. In most art books there are step by step demonstrations but in abstract art the focus is on bringing out the artwork form within the individual. Rolina&#39;s study tips help one begin the journey towards achieving this goal. The study tips are arranged as assignments but deliberately not in the form of step by step examples. Rolina says this type of procedure is a direct opposition of the abstract method, and that focus is own one&#39;s own efforts and talent and that the student must avoid copying to any extent at all. The illustrations accompanying the assignments are there purely to give impetus to one&#39;s own artistic aspirations. Rolina shows the student via this book how to practise artistic and expressive skills, something essential to the art of abstract painting. The emphasis is on bringing out expression from within oneself. When one paints reality the external information is there as a guide, whereas abstract comes completely from within oneself and we need to learn methods to make the appropriate choices of shape, colour, texture and composition. As there is a lack of external guidance we need to learn how to make these choices in order to form a pleasing artwork. The study tips are directed at helping us to achieve this, and to learn to direct our creative thinking into an artwork with focus, direction and restraint. This book is full of beautiful illustrations and excellent tips to enable us to compose thought provoking and evocative abstract paintings. It shows how we can use a variety of media in our journey and how to give rein, direction and control to our free thinking. It&#39;s a fascinating book for everybody, whether they are just starting in abstract, artists wishing to obtain more freedom in their works or simply people interested in learning more about abstract art. A fabulous and unusual treat.-JeannieZelos.com This is Rolina Van Vliet&#39;s second book and pretty much picks up where Painting Abstracts left off. The subtitle, A Guide to Creativity and Free Expression slightly begs a question, but emphasises that this is very much a series about the creative aspects of abstract painting rather than the practical matter of getting paint onto paper or canvas. This, it seems to me, is a very reasonable approach and it&#39;s unlikely that you&#39;re going to tackle the non-representational route if you&#39;re not reasonably comfortable with your materials. Indeed, it&#39;s probably not to be recommended at all. The matter of begging the question is simply, can you teach creativity? On balance, I&#39;d have to give that a qualified yes. Abstraction is very much about ways of seeing and it&#39;s really not unreasonable to say that you can introduce the ideas of a different vision just as you can explain that, in a straightforward landscape, you need to decide which elements of the picture you&#39;re going to concentrate on, which are going to be just suggested and which you&#39;ll probably leave out altogether. In a word: composition. All painting could be said to be chiefly about shapes, colour and balance and the basic principle of abstraction is that this is all you give yourself to work with: the normal points of relativity, the recognisable forms, are removed so that the viewer can only work with what you give them. As such, they have to find your point of view and abandon their own and it&#39;s this, as much as anything else, that makes abstract art difficultA&#34; and frequently uncomfortable. Working backwards from a wide variety of finished paintings, Rolina takes you through the techniques that are available, from visual cues to colour, texture and composition, giving a very practical approach to what is, well, an abstract subject.-Artbookreview.net Abstract painting is unlike any other kind, and needs a special approach. The subtitle of this primer is &#34;A Guide To Creativity and Free Expression&#34; and aims to get to the root of why you have chosen abstract over figurative painting, and what you want to get out of it. As someone who enjoys fabric painting I was interested in a book like this, which offers the scope to escape, through decorating my cloth with more abstract designs. This is not a book on fabric painting I hasten to add, but there is no reason why the ideas in here cannot be used in other media. It gets you thinking about what you want to achieve, and starts off by getting the reader to ask themselves various questions, a method that many books on other painting styles might do well to also start with! This is a book about searching for freedom, and encourages the reader to play with styles and techniques, continually asking yourself questions about what your painting represents and means to you. What do other people get out of looking at your work or other abstract paintings? What do certain shapes and forms imply? As with any other style of painting you need to learn something of color theory, also texture, balance, use of space, etc. To facilitate all this there are a number of exercises to try out, and all in all, I found it a stimulating way of working that was likely to come up with some pleasing work. If you are an artist of any level wanting to try out abstract painting this is a good place to start.-Myshelf.com This new guide bypasses step-by-step instructions, concentrating rather on the creative and aesthetic aspects of abstract painting. However, it&#39;s much more than just a catalogue of concepts and ideas and there are plenty of practical tips that will help you turn what you see in your mind&#39;s eye into a finished painting.-The Artist</p><h2>Treasures Grade 4:</h2><p>All pages and cover are intact (including the dust cover, if applicable).

And the longer he did it, the better he became. And the better he became, the harder it was to escape. The harder it was to escape, the bigger the stain on the very fabric of his soul.

His property backed onto a large, rambling park that surrounded one the city&#x2019;s many lakes. The park let him have the illusion of living in the woods.<br><br> Mr. Lumberjack, living in the woods, swinging his axe.<br><br> <i>Swing, crack! Swing, crack!</i><br><br> Despite the cold wet weather, he was sweating inside the layers of clothing he wore&#x2014;thermal underwear, a flannel shirt, a down-filled vest. He hated this time of year. Every day was shorter than the last. Night began to fall in late afternoon. Winter could arrive on any given day, and stay until April. They had had an ice storm on Halloween and a blizzard on Veteran&#x2019;s Day, followed by three days of rain that had caused flash flooding in low-lying areas. The odd day of stunning, electric blue skies and a paltry few lingering fall colors couldn&#x2019;t make up for the stretches of bleak gray or the damp cold that knifed to the bone. It buried its blade between his shoulders as he wiped the moisture from his face on the sleeve of his shirt, and hoisted the axe again.<br><br> <i>Swing, crack!</i><br><br> The temperature was dropping quickly. The intermittent spitting rain that had been falling off and on all afternoon was giving way to a pelting snow that cut like tiny shards of glass, stinging his ruddy cheeks.<br><br> Every winter he bitched about the Minnesota weather and vowed to move to Florida the day he retired from the police department. But if he moved to Florida, he wouldn&#x2019;t have any reason to split wood. What would he do for his sanity then?<br><br> Like he stood any chance of getting away from here anyway, he thought, looking up at the house, where lights had come on in the kitchen and in one bedroom upstairs. His family all lived in Bloomington. Barbie The Ball Buster&#x2019;s family was entrenched in the southern suburbs. The kids had all their cousins and friends here.<br><br> Maybe he should go alone. Maybe everyone would be happier if he did.<br><br> He sighed and picked up another chunk of wood, set it on end on the stump, stepped back and swung the axe.<br><br> Mr. Lumberjack. Mr. Sex Crimes Detective of the Year. Featured speaker at conferences all over the Midwest. Expert on the subject of human degradation.<br><br> <i>Swing, crack! Swing, crack!</i><br><br> He tried to concentrate on the silence between the small explosions of the axe striking the wood. He sucked cold air into his smoke-blackened lungs. His heart pounded too hard from the effort. The muscles in his shoulders cramped. He felt like he might have a heart attack at any moment.<br><br> Barbie would revive him and kill him again with her bare hands, furious to be left with the kids and the mortgage and the Catholic school tuitions.<br><br> Theirs was a marriage in the way of many couples&#x2014;a partnership of paychecks that didn&#x2019;t stretch far enough, intimacy a thing of memory, the future a projected image at the far end of a treadmill that ran too fast.<br><br> Some days all he wanted was off.<br><br> They resented each other more days than not. His wife had ceased to think of him as a man. He was a paycheck, a roommate, a pain in the ass. He had sought validation elsewhere. It wasn&#x2019;t hard to get. Consequently, it didn&#x2019;t mean anything. And the spiral of his life went down and down. He didn&#x2019;t like what his marriage had become. He didn&#x2019;t like what he had become.<br><br> His grandmother had always warned him about purgatory. Hell&#x2019;s waiting room, she used to call it. Purgatory had become his life.<br><br> Sometimes he wondered if death could be so much worse.<br><br> <i>Swing, crack! Swing, crack!</i><br><br> <i>Crack! Crack!<br><br></i> The final two sounds seemed to come from far away, like an echo.<br><br> Ted Duffy was dead before he could wonder why.<br><br> The first bullet hit him between the shoulder blades as he held the axe high over his head. It shattered bone and deflated a lung, tearing through a major artery. The second bullet struck him in the head, entering above the right ear, exiting below the left eye.<br><br>He dropped face-first to the ground at the base of the tree stump, his eyes open but seeing nothing, blood pooling beneath his cheek and seeping into the new-fallen snow.<br><b>2</b><br>November<br> Present Day<br> Minneapolis, MN<br><br> &#x201c;Duffy was a great guy.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not one of the criteria for picking a cold case,&#x201d; Nikki Liska argued.<br><br> Gene Grider narrowed his eyes. He had a face like a bulldog, and breath to match. &#x201c;What the hell is wrong with you? Do you need a Midol or something?&#x201d;<br><br> She wrinkled her nose at him. &#x201c;What decade did you crawl up out of, Grider? Smells like 1955.&#x201d;<br><br> Grider had worked Homicide before her time, but not that long before her time. He had put in thirty years, doing stints in Homicide, Robbery, and Sex Crimes. His last few years on the job had been spent working special community initiatives&#x2014;jobs Nikki would have thought required a lot more charm than Grider could scrape together on his best day.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s twenty-five years since Duff was gunned down,&#x201d; he said, slamming his hand down on the table. &#x201c;Twenty-five years this month! It&#x2019;s a disgrace that this case has never been solved. This is what I&#x2019;m coming out of retirement for. We&#x2019;re finally getting a dedicated cold case unit. This case should be front and center!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like nobody&#x2019;s worked the case,&#x201d; Liska said. &#x201c;People have worked the case all along.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;On the side, with no money,&#x201d; Grider complained.<br><br> Which was exactly how the majority of cold cases were worked all over the country&#x2014;piecemeal, if at all. Cold case units were far more common on television than in reality. In the real world, police departments operated on taxpayer dollars, funding that was continually being cut to the bone. Homicide detectives all had their old unsolved cases that they continued to chip away at when they could, and passed them on to other detectives when they transferred or retired. It was a wonder any of them got solved, considering.<br><br> &#x201c;The same as all of these cases,&#x201d; Nikki pointed out.<br><br> She had spent the last two months going half blind reviewing cold cases dating back to the mid-seventies. Of the two hundred cases she had evaluated, she had pulled sixty seven for the final round of reviews. Grider had looked through another two hundred and pulled fifty nine. They had whittled the list down to a hundred, and now had to prioritize. They would be lucky if the federal grant money being used to set up the unit got them through half the cases on their short list.<br><br> &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t the same thing,&#x201d; Grider snapped. &#x201c;Duff was one of us. Where the hell is your loyalty?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t about loyalty,&#x201d; Liska said. &#x201c;It can&#x2019;t matter that Duffy was a cop&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Nice to know what you think of your peers,&#x201d; Grider sneered.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, get off your high horse,&#x201d; she snapped. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about solvability. We&#x2019;ve got a limited budget. We have to go after the cases we have a hope in hell of closing. You couldn&#x2019;t close Duffy&#x2019;s case in twenty-five years for a reason&#x2014;there&#x2019;s jack shit to go on. He was shot from a distance. There were no witnesses, no fingerprints, no DNA, no trace evidence of any value,&#x201d; she said, ticking the points off on her fingers.<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re supposed to spend money and man hours going back over a case not likely to ever be solved?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;What case doesn&#x2019;t make the cut because we&#x2019;re giving priority to an unsolvable crime? The serial rapes from 1997? The child murder from 1985? The hit-and-run death of a father of six? Which one do we leave out? All of those cases have forensic evidence that can be retested with better technology than before. All of them are potentially solvable.&#x201d;<br><br> The new Homicide lieutenant, Joan Mascherino, looked from Liska to Grider and back like an impassive tennis umpire.<br><br> She was a neat and proper woman with auburn hair cut in a neat and proper style. Perfectly polished in her conservative gray suit and pearl earrings, she was Liska&#x2019;s height&#x2014;short. Kindred spirits in the world of the vertically challenged&#x2014;or so Nikki hoped.<br><br>She had learned long ago to take any advantage she could get in this profession still dominated by men. She certainly wasn&#x2019;t above playing the girls-gotta-stick-together card when she could do it subtly. But Joan Mascherino hadn&#x2019;t gotten where she was by being a pushover. In her mid-fifties, she had come on the job when discrimination against women was a way of life, and still worked her way up the ranks to lieutenant. Running Homicide was just another feather in her cap on her way to bigger things. Rumor had it she would be on her way upstairs to rub elbows with the deputy chiefs in the not-too-distant future.<br><br> Homicide&#x2019;s last boss, Kasselmann, had used the closing of the Doc Holiday murders as a springboard to being named Deputy Chief of the Investigations Bureau&#x2014;as if he&#x2019;d had anything to do with solving the serial killer&#x2019;s crimes. He just happened to be sitting in the office at the time.<br><br> Mascherino had come over from Internal Affairs just in time to be handed the plum of putting together the cold case unit, which would&#x2014;initially, at least&#x2014;be high profile and put her in the media spotlight.<br><br> Gene Grider, retired for eighteen months, had come back to work this unit, offering himself at part-time pay, which made him very attractive to the number crunchers trying to squeeze every penny out of the grant money. But it also augmented Grider&#x2019;s pension, and allowed him to bring his own agenda along with him. His agenda was Ted Duffy.<br><br>And so went the law enforcement food chain.<br><br> Nikki had her own agenda too. She had leveraged her role in closing the Doc Holiday cases to get Kasselmann to recommend her to this unit. When she caught a case in Homicide, it wasn&#x2019;t unusual to be on for twenty-four hours or more, straight. In Cold Case, there was no urgency. There were regular hours, giving her more time with her boys.<br><br> She had spent the better part of a decade in Homicide. The unit was her home away from home, her family away from family. She loved the job, was very good at the job. But RJ and Kyle, at fourteen and sixteen, were growing into young men, struggling through the pitfalls of adolescence as they made the transition from boyhood to independence and maturity. They needed an adult available, and she was it. God knew their father didn&#x2019;t qualify for the job.<br><br> It had been during the height of the Doc Holiday hunt that Nikki had realized she didn&#x2019;t know enough about what was going on in the life of her oldest son, Kyle. The lives of teenagers were so much more complicated now than when she was a kid. They could be lost so easily while she was looking away&#x2014;lost literally and figuratively. No matter how much she loved her job, she loved her boys a million times more.<br><br> News of the grant money coming in for a cold case unit had started circulating at the perfect time. She would still be investigating homicides, but the urgency and long hours of a fresh case would be removed. The challenges would be different, but she would still be fighting for a victim.<br><br> Except that at the moment she was fighting against a victim. Another detective, no less.<br><br>&#x201c;If Ted Duffy&#x2019;s murder isn&#x2019;t on this agenda, I&#x2019;m out of here,&#x201d; Grider threatened.<br><br>Like he was some kind of super cop. Like he was Derek Jeter coming out of retirement to save the Yankees or something.<br><br> &#x201c;And every cop in Minneapolis is going to be up in arms about it,&#x201d; Grider said, cutting a hard look at Liska. &#x201c;Except this one,&#x201d; he muttered, then put his attention back on the people he wanted to sway. &#x201c;Duffy&#x2019;s is the only unsolved homicide on the books involving a police officer. It&#x2019;s a black eye on the department. And I would think now&#x2014;especially now&#x2014;that would mean something.&#x201d;<br><br> Liska sat up straighter, incredulous. &#x201c;Is that a threat? Is that what you&#x2019;re trying to so cleverly slip into that rant? You&#x2019;ll set a fire amongst the rank and file if you don&#x2019;t get your way?&#x201d;<br><br> Grider shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying people are already on edge.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a fucking bully.&#x201d;<br><br> Lieutenant Mascherino cut her a disapproving look. &#x201c;We can do without the language, Sergeant.&#x201d;<br><br> Nikki bit her tongue. Great. She had a mouth like a sailor on holiday, and a schoolmarm for a lieutenant.<br><br> They sat at a round white melamine table in a war room commandeered from Homicide. Round tables were supposed to foster feelings of equality and cooperation, according to the industrial and organizational psychology expert the department had wasted taxpayer dollars on during the last remodeling of the offices. The same expert had recommended painting the office walls mauve, and had told them they needed to remove the U bolts from the walls and floors in the interview rooms so they had nowhere to cuff violent offenders if the need arose, because the threat of physical restraint might be deemed &#x201c;intimidating.&#x201d;<br><br> Nikki could still see the look on her partner Kovac&#x2019;s face as they listened to the presentation. Nobody had a better &#x201c;Are you fucking kidding me?&#x201d; face than Kovac.<br><br> Weeks later a suspect had yanked a useless decorative shelf off the wall of an interview room and cracked Kovac in the head with it. He still had a little scar. Nikki had kneecapped the suspect with her tactical baton before he could do worse.

American captain George Anthony risked his career as a whaler&#x2014;and his life&#x2014;to rescue a group of British-soldiers-turned-Irish-rebels known as &#x201c;The Fremantle Six&#x201d; from their prison in Australia. With the help of the prison chaplain, the six men escaped to the coast where Anthony was waiting with a small whaleboat that would take them to the Catalpa. The resistance they overcame, both from armed British vessels and a furious sea storm, made their escape the stuff of legend. In what Britain considered a near act of war, the Catalpa outran the Royal Navy and deposited its politically dangerous cargo in New York Harbor in August 1876. Fast-paced, compelling, and meticulously researched, this saga of American, Irish, British, and Australian history is the first full telling of the Catalpa&#x2019;s voyage. The expedition was embraced by Irish and Irish-Americans as the very symbol of defiance against Great Britain and would loom large in the revolutionary rhetoric of Michael Collins. Though Captain Anthony would never again sail into international waters for fear of arrest by the British government, his rescue voyage, made mostly without the use of a functioning chronometer, is one of the greatest feats of seamanship in nautical annals and one of the most daring deeds performed by an American in the name of Irish independence. Included are eight pages of black-and-white photographs.</p><p>Peter Stevens is a correspondent for the BOSTON IRISH REPORTER. His articles appear regularly in AMERICAN HERITAGE, AMERICAN HISTORY, YANKEE, CIVIL WAR TIMES, MILITARY HISTORY, and TRUE WEST.Truth may routinely be stranger than fiction, but seldom is it as suspenseful as this story of the 1876 rescue of six Irish rebels from Britain's infamous prison colony in Fremantle, Australia, by the American whaling ship Catalpa. Despite its title, the book covers far more than just the rescue ship's voyage, bringing to life the web of political interests and conflicts among Ireland, England and the U.S. toward the end of the 19th century. In his fast-moving narrative, journalist Stevens (The Mayflower Murderer and Other Forgotten Firsts in American History) tells how the six Irish members of the British Armed Forces were recruited and then arrested for treachery because of their allegiance to the rebellious Fenian movement for Irish independence. He describes the ordeal of the Irishmen in prison, as well as the plotting of the clandestine rescue mission, which launched from New Bedford, Mass., and took a year to complete in the face of hostile British forces. The writing is solid if workmanlike. Stevens doesn't shrink from getting into the heads of his subjects, and takes some liberties in reconstructing their thoughts and actions in minute, novelistic detail. The freewheeling approach may trouble some readers, especially as Stevens doesn't cite sources (he's based much of the book on the firsthand account of Catalpa captain George Anthony). Ultimately, however, the action-packed international intrigue and Stevens's keen sense of pacing carry the book; readers who can put aside their skepticism will be riveted. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Civil War in Texas and New Mexico Territory</h2><p><p>Many heroic actions were taken by Hispanic soldiers who have not gotten much recognition for their efforts.</p></p><p><p>There are many stories from the Civil War; some of the ones that took place in the West have been overlooked.

Between 1968 and 1991, as regular film reviewer for <i>The New Yorker</i>, Kael used those formidable tools to shape the tastes of a generation, enthralling readers with her gift for capturing, with force and fluency, the essence of an actor's gesture or the full implication of a cinematic image. Kael called movies "the most total and encompassing art form we have," and she made her reviews a platform for considering both film and the worlds it engages, crafting in the process a prose style of extraordinary wit, precision, and improvisatory grace. To read <i>The Age of Movies</i>, the first new selection in more than a generation, is to be swept up into an endlessly revealing and entertaining dialogue with Kael at her witty, exhilarating, and opinionated best. Her ability to evoke the essence of a great artist-an Orson Welles or a Robert Altman-or to celebrate the way even seeming trash could tap deeply into our emotions was matched by her unwavering eye for the scams and self-deceptions of a corrupt movie industry. Here in this career spanning collection are her appraisals of the films that defined an era-among them <i>Breathless</i>, <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>, <i>The Leopard</i>, <i>The Godfather</i>, <i>Last Tango in Paris</i>, <i>Nashville</i>-along with many others, some awaiting rediscovery, all providing the occasion for masterpieces of observation and insight, alive on every page.</p><p>Pauline Kael reached national attention in the 1960s, first in a brief stint as critic for <b>The New Republic</b>, finally as a longtime fixture at <b>The New Yorker</b> (1968-1991).

She bears powerful testimony of the reality of Jesus Christ, that He cares about us personally and will do for each one of us what He has promised He will do. She discusses our individual, unique missions of mortality, reminding us who we are and who we have always been. And she expands our understanding of the happiness that comes from living the gospel, the power of families, the importance of the priesthood, the security of having a living prophet, the glory of the temple, and the transcendent blessings available to all who seek the Lord.</p><p> But No Doubt About It is much more than an insightful look at foundational gospel principles. It is a stirring call to action, a motivating book that will help readers move beyond knowing to doing. Vivid stories of the author's own experiences demonstrate how these truths apply in real-world settings. ''We no longer have the luxury of spending our energy on anything that doesn't lead us and our families to Christ,'' writes Sister Dew. ''In the days ahead, a casual commitment to Christ will not carry us through. The time has come for each of us to stand tall, and then, in doing so, to stand together.''</p><p>Latter-day Saints across the world have come to appreciate Sheri Dew's personable style, her memorable stories, and her solid understanding of doctrine. No Doubt About It is a wonderful blend of all three, the book people have been asking for and one that will change their lives for the better.</p></p><p><b>Sheri Dew</b> is a native of Ulysses, Kansas, and a graduate of Brigham Young University.

In March 2003 the White House appointed her as a member of the U.S. Delegation to the Commission on the Status of Women and Girls at the United Nations.By far the best book ever written regarding things of eternal importance! This book should be a gift to EVERY new convert to the Church and given to them at their baptism because it is the most faith-strengthening book that I've ever read! It sticks to the Scriptures, as found in the Standard works, and gives generous quotes from the Brethren, and I would recommend this book to anyone who is a Latter-day Saint who is having doubts about our faith. This book settles the question as to truthfulness of the Gospel with more power and clarity that any other work I've ever read! --Eric<br><br>I bought this book about two months ago and finally have started to read it.

From the highest levels of the U.S. government to the lowest levels of street crime, the Syndicate infiltrated everything from gambling to politics. Here is the best-selling account of the gangsters who called themselves &#34;Murder, Inc.&#34; from the Assistant District Attorney who sent seven of them to the electric chair.</p><p><b>Burton B. Turkus</b> was an Assistant District Attorney in Brooklyn, New York. <b>Sid Feder</b> was a veteran journalist.</p><h2>True Crime</h2><p>Private detective Nathan Heller goes undercover into the dark and violent world of the Chicago outlaw gangs of the 1930s to find a farmer&#39;s-daughter-turned-gun-moll</p><p>1934 Chicago dazzles with fast action and calculating, cold-blooded meanness as private detective Nate Heller combs Chicago&#x2019;s North Side looking for John Dillinger. But things take a turn for the strange when self-aggrandizing G-Man Melvin Purvis shoots down a Dillinger double in front of the Biograph Theater. Full of muscle and oozing Chicago&#x2019;s tough-guy persona to the hilt, Max Allan Collins&#x2019; Nate Heller is the ultimate private investigator&#x2014;in the ultimate P.I. town. Heller&#x2019;s undercover search for a farmer&#x2019;s-daughter-turned-gun-moll has him on the dusty Depression backroads of middle America, in the company of Ma Barker and her boys, Baby Face Nelson, Alvin Karpis, and a very-much-still-alive Dillinger&#x2014;whose outlandish plan to kidnap J. Edgar Hoover in downtown Chicago is one Heller tries to foil.

The once-shining capital city of Tenochtitlan has been renamed Mexico City. Eighteen-year-old Tenamaxtli, the novel's hero, has traveled with his mother from the northern region, where they have been kept abreast of the progress of the malignant, marauding, disease-bearing Spanish. In the course of witnessing the execution of an old Aztec, Tenamaxtli's mother reveals that the victim is, in fact, her son's father. Everything is in place for vengeance, and over the novel's next several years, Tenamaxtli organizes an ill-fated insurrection, enjoying many sexual adventures along the way. <p>Told plainly and at some remove, Jennings has reserved the fancier footwork for an excursion into Aztec culture, creating a detailed tapestry of a struggling, vanquished race. Readers familiar with Mexican history will welcome the rich details of this vengeance drama; those new to it will be impressed by Jennings's exhaustive research. </p><p> The narrative reads like a journal, its language meant to evoke some generic past. Perhaps this is a distancing device, allowing readers to focus on the rich weave of cultural and historic elements rather than the carnage, cruelty, and genocide that characterize this unhappy piece of Mexican history.</p>GARY JENNINGS was known for the rigorous and intensive research behind his novels, which often included hazardous travel. He passed away in 1999, leaving behind a rich legacy of historical fiction and outlines for new novels. <br><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Wish, Vol. 3</h2><p>Many lessons are learned after Shuichiro saves an angel stuck in a tree and is granted one wish to repay his generosity.</p><p>CLAMP is an all-female team and one of the hottest groups of manga creators in Japan today.

One afternoon a sailor asked him to pipe a tune, and that evening Jessie was kidnapped and dumped aboard <i>The Moonlight</i>, a slave ship, where a hateful duty awaited him. He was to play music so the slaves could "dance" to keep their muscles strong, their bodies profitable. Jessie was sickened by the thought of taking part in the business of trading rum and tobacco for blacks and then selling the ones who survived the frightful sea voyage from Africa. But to the men of the ship a "slave dancer" was necessary to ensure their share of the profit. They did not heed the horrors that every day grew more vivid, more inescapable to Jessie. Yet , even after four months of fear, calculated torture, and hazardous sailing with a degraded crew, Jessie was to face a final horror that would stay with him for the rest of his life.</p><p>"Fox has woven a spellbinding tale of suspense and survival that will horrify as well as fascinate..."<p>-- Library Journal (starred review)</p><p>"A story that movingly and realistically presents one of the most gruesome chapters of history, with all the violence, inhuman conditions, and bestial aspects of human nature -- exposed but never exploited in Fox's graphic, documentary prose."</p><p>-- Booklist (starred review)</p>An Excerpt from <i>The Slave Dancer</i><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard one piercing scream. My teeth began to chatter.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a very small brown face rose above the rail as though it had flown <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up from the sea. It continued to rise slowly until its brown bare chest <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was visible. Then I saw dark hands around its waist. The hands lifted, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the little girl's legs flew out, and I saw the head of the young man who <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had been carrying her.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a second, she sat on the deck, looking all around her, her eyes huge <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with amazement, then she crawled and jumped toward the rail but was forced <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back by the forward propulsion of the man who tottered over the rail, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unable, it seemed, to bring his body any further. The child hugged the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;young man's neck frantically and buried her face in his hair. At that <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moment, Nicholas Spark bent his thin length and gripped the man's back <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as though he were gathering up cloth, and yanked him altogether over, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the chains around his ankles striking the deck with a violent clanging.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clanging never ceased as one after another the captives struggled <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over the rail and were dropped or dragged onto the deck. How long did <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it all take? I'll never know.

This collection is a fitting complement to Rolvaag&#39;s sweeping novels of American frontier life.

Pushkin did fieldwork and research that would be the envy of any historian, and then fashioned it into a powerful literary narrative of uprising and rebellion. The first English translation of a masterpiece that has become a Russian classic.<br></p><p>Aleksandr Sergeyevich Pushkin, b. June 6 (N.S.), 1799, d. Feb. 10 (N.S.), 1837, was Russia&#39;s greatest poet. His use of the vernacular as the language of poetry freed Russian writing from the constraints of tradition and set new literary standards for novelists and poets, and his preference for subjects from history and folklore brought fresh vitality to Russian literature.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Kingdoms of Kalamar: Campaign Setting Sourcebook (Dungeons &amp; Dragons d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)</h2><p>Kingdoms of Kalamar is a fully-detailed campaign setting for use with Dungeons &amp; Dragons. <p>This comprehensive sourcebook provides a wealth of information on the nations of Tellene, their history, their politics, and their people.

In addition, there are chapters that cover research methods, theory, prenatal development, childbirth, health and risk, and family and culture, and the long-term effects of the infancy period. Similar to Alan Fogel&#39;s classic text, Infancy: Infant, family, and society, 6th Edition (Sloan Publishing), which is organized by ages and stages, Infant Development: A Topical Approach brings the same balance of careful scientific review of the literature, down-to-earth writing style that appeals to students, as well as many applied topics relevant to the life of infants and their families. These include infant maltreatment, attachment, poverty, infant mental health, and nutrition. Many topics are relevant to parenting such as prenatal maternal health, parental adaptation to a new baby, parental employment, and the effects of infants with special needs on families.</p><p></p><h2>Trail Guide to the Body Flashcards Vol 2: Muscles of the Body</h2><p>Flashcards are a powerful way to learn and memorize anatomical structures - especially when they have images identical to those in the textbook.

Raised on the unforgiving streets of Hong Kong, she was pulled into the agency at the age of fourteen, already having accumulated more insight and secrets than the most seasoned professionals in her world. If life has taught her anything, it is not to get attached, but there are two exceptions to that rule: her son Luke and her mentor Hu Chang. </p><p>When Luke was kidnapped at the age of two, it nearly broke her. Now, nine years later, her son has astonishingly been returned to her and Catherine vows never to fail him again. But when her job pulls her away from home, she relies on the brilliant and deadly Hu Chang to safeguard Luke in her absence. Erin Sullivan, an American journalist with mysterious ties to Hu Chang, has been kidnapped in Tibet. If Catherine doesn't agree to spearhead the CIA rescue mission, she knows that Hu Chang himself will go, a possibility she can't risk. But she will be facing a monster whose crimes stretch back forty years, always eluding the CIA. </p><p>The job grows even more complicated when Catherine meets Richard Cameron, a supposed ally who's clearly not telling all he knows. Their attraction is immediate, but Catherine isn't at all sure that he can be trusted. If she's going to rescue this journalist with a story worth killing for, she'll need to keep Cameron very close. From the treacherous landscape of the Himalayas to the twisting back alleys of San Francisco, the clock is ticking for Catherine and those she loves most. At every turn she faces a ruthless enemy who is determined to keep the truth buried, even if it means that none of them live to see tomorrow, in this <i>New York Times </i>bestselling novel from Iris Johansen.</p></p><p><p>IRIS JOHANSEN is <i>The New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Silencing Eve</i>, <i>Hunting Eve</i>, <i>Taking Eve</i>, <i>Close Your Eyes</i>, <i>Sleep No More</i>, <i>What Doesn't Kill You</i>, <i>Bonnie</i>, <i>Quinn</i>, <i>Eve</i>, <i>Chasing The Night</i>, <i>Eight Days to Live</i>, <i>Blood Game</i>, <i>Storm Cycle,</i> and <i>Silent Thunder</i> (with Roy Johansen), <i>Deadlock, Dark Summer</i>, <i>Pandora's Daughter</i>, <i>Quicksand</i>, <i>Killer Dreams</i>, <i>On The Run</i>, <i>Countdown</i>, <i>Firestorm</i>, <i>Fatal Tide</i>, <i>Dead Aim</i>, <i>No One To Trust </i>and more.

Catherine Ling wondered as she looked down through the clouds from the window of the jet approaching Hong Kong. Other people would have found it strange that she had never regarded this exotic, wonderful, terrible city as her home place. She had spent her childhood here on the streets struggling, sometimes starving, always having to use her mind and wits just to stay alive. It was only when she was fourteen and had been chosen by Venable to go to work for the CIA that she had left the city. Perhaps it was because she had never been at ease enough to think of it as a haven. Wasn&#x2019;t a home supposed to offer safe haven? <br>Her cell phone was vibrating, and she frowned as she looked down at it. <br>Venable. <br>Should she ignore it? She had no desire to argue with him right now. Venable hadn&#x2019;t wanted her to go to Hong Kong to be with her son. He&#x2019;d had that job for her to do in Guatemala City, and he could be as stubborn as he was devious. But if she didn&#x2019;t get the argument settled now, she&#x2019;d have to face it when she was with Luke and Hu Chang after the plane landed. Venable would keep trying until he reached her. He never gave up. <br>&#x201c;What is it, Venable?&#x201d; she asked curtly as she accessed the call. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t talk very long. I should be landing within the next fifteen or twenty minutes.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know. I timed the call that way. It had to not be enough time for you to smolder and build up resistance and just enough time to spark that mind of yours into gear.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to Guatemala City. Forget it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already forgotten it. I&#x2019;ve sent Tolliver. I really didn&#x2019;t want to send you there anyway. You were much more suited for this other job I&#x2019;ve had in mind for you for the last week. It just had a few awkward ramifications I didn&#x2019;t want to deal with.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And where was this job?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Tibet. I decided that since you were so determined to go to Hong Kong, I&#x2019;d give you work closer to there.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Bullshit. It may be close in distance, but it&#x2019;s a world away in every other aspect.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Unfortunately, that&#x2019;s true. And this one isn&#x2019;t going to be easy. If I didn&#x2019;t need you, I&#x2019;d give it to the local guy and let you take your vacation.&#x201d; <br>Her voice was soft. &#x201c;Let?&#x201d; <br>He chuckled. &#x201c;Wrong word. I&#x2019;ll rephrase it. I wouldn&#x2019;t try to persuade you to postpone your time with your son. There were a few headaches connected to bringing you into it. I actually was looking for another agent even though you&#x2019;re as close to perfect as I could get.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Catherine said with precision. &#x201c;Not Guatemala. Not Tibet.&#x201d; <br>He continued as if he hadn&#x2019;t heard her. &#x201c;But I decided to leave it up to fate. If you&#x2019;d agreed to Guatemala, I&#x2019;d accept it. If not, you were mine.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not listening to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m listening to every word. Believe me, if you weren&#x2019;t so good, I&#x2019;d let you out of this one. As I said, bringing you in may be a major headache.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good. Then you won&#x2019;t feel too disappointed if I refuse the assignment. Venable, for God&#x2019;s sake, what can I say to convince you that I&#x2019;m going to spend these next few weeks with my son and my friend, Hu Chang. Then I&#x2019;m going to take Luke back to Louisville to start the school year. Period. End of discussion.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not quite. You&#x2019;ve not allowed me to offer my side of the discussion. Have you ever heard of Erin Sullivan?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No. Yes.&#x201d; Memory was stirring as she made the connection. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a journalist. There was some kind of big fuss about her a few years ago. I didn&#x2019;t pay much attention to it. You were keeping me busy down in Venezuela at the time.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not exactly a fuss. She won a Pulitzer for her stories about the earthquake at Qinghai Province in Tibet a few years ago.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;She also worked side by side with the monks and the Chinese soldiers rescuing the victims of the quake. By the time the Chinese government decided that Erin Sullivan was gaining too much star power and influence among the Tibetan people, it was too late. The villagers throughout the mountains were regarding her as their angel of mercy. <br>&#x201c;Very admirable. And dangerous. China doesn&#x2019;t appreciate interference in their policies in Tibet. But she&#x2019;s an American, and that gave her an umbrella of safety. She had no desire to be an activist. She didn&#x2019;t consider it her place. She just helped where she could.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So why are we talking about Erin Sullivan?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Unfortunately, she&#x2019;s become a problem for us.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How? You said that she&#x2019;s not trying to stir up trouble.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sometimes people cause turmoil just by being what they are.&#x201d; He added dryly, &#x201c;If an angel of mercy becomes a victim, then that means a martyr. Martyrs can ignite wars.&#x201d; <br>She stiffened. &#x201c;And has Erin Sullivan become a martyr?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t believe it&#x2019;s gone that far yet. What we do know is that she disappeared on her way to write a story about an orphanage in the mountains two months ago. She hasn&#x2019;t been seen since.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why hasn&#x2019;t her newspaper raised hell?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s freelance.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She just dropped off the face of the Earth?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say that. There have been rumors.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Rumors from what source?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The same source that sent me a tip that the unrest and revolt building among the Tibetans because of Sullivan&#x2019;s disappearance might cause an upset with big brother China if it wasn&#x2019;t addressed. It wouldn&#x2019;t take much to do that. China has always been more ready to attack than negotiate.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And China was responsible for Sullivan&#x2019;s disappearance?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not that we can confirm.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Stop pussyfooting around. If she&#x2019;s been missing two months, you must have an idea where she is. You wouldn&#x2019;t want to send me in blind if you didn&#x2019;t. She&#x2019;s an American citizen.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And Tibet is still a wild and desolate land where anyone could be lost for decades and never found. We&#x2019;ve been making inquiries and tapping our sources.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sources, again. What sources, Venable?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Have I piqued your curiosity, Catherine?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;ve been trained to question and probe. You had a hand in that training.&#x201d; But she had been caught and held by the story of Erin Sullivan. It made her angry. She hated the idea of good people being thrown to the wolves as the journalist probably had been. She supposed she should be accustomed to the lack of fairness in the world by now, but she never got used to it. &#x201c;And I won&#x2019;t let you lure me into searching for her out of sheer curiosity. I left my son for over three weeks while I pulled your hot potatoes out of the fire in Colombia. I want Luke to remember that he has a mother who cares about him. I&#x2019;m sure whoever you send after Erin Sullivan will be competent.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve told me yourself that you have to walk carefully around your son to make sure that you don&#x2019;t overwhelm him. He got along without you for nine years just fine while you were searching for him.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You know he didn&#x2019;t get along fine. Rakovac tried to destroy him and almost succeeded.&#x201d; She felt a ripple of pain as she remembered the torment of those years after Rakovac, a Russian criminal, had tried to punish Catherine by kidnapping her two-year-old son. He had kept him for nine long years and tried to turn him into everything that Catherine would hate. She had only recently managed to free Luke, and they were still tentative with each other. &#x201c;He survived, but I probably won&#x2019;t know how damaged he is for years. Yes, he&#x2019;s had to be independent all his life just to avoid Rakovac&#x2019;s abuse, but now he has to know I&#x2019;m there for him.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He has his tutor, Sam O&#x2019;Neill, and Hu Chang.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m his mother, dammit.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;A mother who Luke isn&#x2019;t sure he knows what to do with,&#x201d; Venable said bluntly. &#x201c;He knows about surviving neglect and torture. He knows about a man who put a gun in his hand when he was a small child and took him on guerrilla raids. He doesn&#x2019;t know about normal relations.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s learning,&#x201d; she said fiercely. &#x201c;Every time we&#x2019;re together we get a little closer. Yes, I have to be careful not to let him know how much I&#x2014;&#x201d; She stopped. She wouldn&#x2019;t reveal to Venable the aching frustration of having to restrain the deep, boundless love she felt for Luke. She wanted to reach out, touch him, smother him with the affection that had been stolen from both of them. She couldn&#x2019;t do it. Luke was older than his age in many ways, but his lack of experience in ordinary emotions had stunted him, and he was only now beginning to open to her. She had to hold back, respect that reticence. But God it was hard. <br>&#x201c;Do you think I don&#x2019;t know why you&#x2019;ve been letting me send you on assignments during these last six months?&#x201d; Venable asked softly. &#x201c;I believe Luke may be as torn and confused as you are about how to make the adjustment. You both have to occasionally step back and take a deep breath before you take another step forward.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Very perceptive,&#x201d; Catherine said dryly. She wasn&#x2019;t surprised that Venable had studied her situation and come so close to the exact truth. No one ever underestimated Venable&#x2019;s cleverness. &#x201c;And a convenient explanation for you in this case. Abandon my Luke and go off on CIA business because it&#x2019;s good for us as well as the country. No deal, Venable.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Think about it. Look Erin Sullivan up on the Internet. Get to know her.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The hell I will.&#x201d; <br>Venable chuckled. &#x201c;I think you will. I&#x2019;ll get off the line now so you can check her out before your plane begins its descent.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Wait.&#x201d; She had just thought of something else. &#x201c;You said bringing me into the mission would cause you big problems. Why?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I was wondering when you&#x2019;d ask that question. It all has to do with my source. He doesn&#x2019;t want you involved.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to ask him.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And how am I supposed to do that when you won&#x2019;t tell me who he is? I take it you&#x2019;ve changed your mind.&#x201d; She stiffened as she began to have an outrageous suspicion. &#x201c;Just who is your source?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Someone you know very well,&#x201d; he said quietly. &#x201c;Hu Chang.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What the hell? What&#x2019;s Hu&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>But Venable had already hung up. <br>What did Hu Chang have to do with Erin Sullivan? He might slide in and out of political situations like a Las Vegas magician if he chose, but he seldom chose. At least, she didn&#x2019;t think he often dabbled in the fates of nations any longer. What did she know? After all these years, he was still an enigma to her. She had met him when she was only fourteen and had been on the streets selling information to the highest bidder. He had been a practitioner of Chinese medicine, and they had bonded and become friends. She had not learned until later that Hu Chang was also the foremost creator of poisons in the world and sold them to the highest bidder. By that time, it had not mattered to her. He was her friend. He had saved her life, and she had saved his. Two solitary people who had found one person they could trust to make the loneliness go away. <br> <i>He doesn&#x2019;t want you involved.</i> <br>Well, dammit, she didn&#x2019;t want to be involved. <br>But why did Hu Chang want to close her out? <br>She pulled out her computer and flipped it open. <br>The next moment, she had drawn up the story of the Qinghai earthquake. The second story she accessed she saw the photo of Erin Sullivan. She was standing beside a monk and a Chinese soldier, and she was frowning as she stared down at the wreckage below her. <br>Catherine had thought she&#x2019;d be older, but the woman looked to be close to her own age. She wasn&#x2019;t over thirty, perhaps a little younger. She was tall, slim even in the bulky, cold-weather garments she was wearing. She had on a black, hooded jacket and matching pants and brown, fur-lined boots. A strand of copper red hair had escaped her hood and lay on her forehead above eyes that were large and a gray-green hazel. Not a beautiful woman, but she had an interesting bone structure and a full, wonderful mouth. Her expression was mature and intelligent and troubled as she looked down at the devastation in the valley below. <br>Who wouldn&#x2019;t have been troubled? Catherine thought. Several thousand people had been killed in that quake. She quickly scanned the info about Erin Sullivan. She had been an Army brat who had traveled all over Europe and the Middle East with her parents. She had earned a scholarship to Stanford University, majored in languages and journalism, held several minor jobs in cities around Europe, and found a niche in a small television station in Calcutta, India. She had worked three years traveling for the station in Pakistan and Tibet, then had quit and become a freelance journalist. According to the story, she had traveled to the quake site on her own to write the story. Then she had stayed to help with the rescue that was being conducted by the monks of the area and the Chinese soldiers who had been sent from Beijing to help. They had needed all the help they could get because the soldiers had become disoriented and physically ill because of the altitude. Erin had worked in these mountains, and the altitude was no problem for her. Both the Tibetan monks and the Chinese soldiers had nothing but praise for her. <br>Clearly a remarkable woman. Why would someone want to target her? <br>&#x201c;We are going to land.&#x201d; The smiling, Asian flight attendant was standing beside her seat. &#x201c;Please put away all electronic devices.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; Catherine nodded, shut off her computer, and slipped it in her bag. She glanced out the window. They should be on the ground within a few minutes. She hoped Hu Chang would be there to meet her. She would see him walking toward her with a faint, mocking smile on that face that was totally ageless. She had questions to ask him that he might not answer. She could never tell if he would dance around or give her the simple truth. As if any truth was simple with a man so complicated. <br>&#x201c;Just what the hell are you up to, Hu Chang?&#x201d; she murmured. <br>DAKSHA PALACETIBET <br>&#x201c;Get <i>out</i> of here, Jafar.&#x201d; Erin Sullivan&#x2019;s voice was shaking as she gazed at the young boy in desperation and fear. She had been stunned when she had seen the boy slip over the windowsill into her bedroom only moments before. Stunned and sick with panic. &#x201c;You should never have come. I&#x2019;ll get out on my own.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I should have come. I was sent.&#x201d; Jafar&#x2019;s huge brown eyes were glowing in his small face. &#x201c;I heard the calling, and I went to my father. He told me to follow the spirits. You can&#x2019;t get across the mountains on your own. I will lead you from this dark place.&#x201d; <br>His father had told him to come to this hellhole? Jafar couldn&#x2019;t be over eleven or twelve years old, Erin thought, agonized. She had grown to know Jafar and his family during the weeks she had spent in his village, but she had not dreamed they&#x2019;d sacrifice their son like this. Perhaps she should have realized it could happen. Like the rest of the people in his village, Jafar was full of dreams and the belief that good would always triumph in the end. Erin knew better. Not here, not anywhere where Paul Kadmus could reach out to crush and mangle. But she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to persuade the child to leave her by using fear. The dreams were too strong, the belief too ingrained. She thought quickly, searching for a way that he would understand. <br>&#x201c;Your father should not have sent you to me. I must fight this battle alone. My special spirit told me that&#x2019;s the only way to gain a higher plane of enlightenment.&#x201d; <br>He frowned. &#x201c;But this is a dark place. We&#x2019;ve heard stories that they hurt you here. <i>He</i> hurts you.&#x201d; He looked at her face. &#x201c;You have bruises.&#x201d; <br>She couldn&#x2019;t deny it. The ugly stories must have been driven from the palace like ice pellets in the wind. Find an excuse. &#x201c;Suffering sometimes cleanses the soul.&#x201d; <br>He was gazing at her doubtfully. <br>She changed the subject. &#x201c;Jafar, how did yo...</p><h2>Moses in the Bulrushes</h2><p>Retells the Old Testament story of how the baby Moses was saved from death by the Pharoah&#39;s daughter.</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 3 In this book, as in his earlier treatment of Jonah and the Great Fish (1984) and Noah and the Great Flood (1977, both Atheneum), Hutton doesn't attempt to tell the whole of an epic figure's story but concentrates on one significant episode. Two sentences at the end encapsulate Moses' later life as leader of his people and "man of God." Hutton's magnificent pen and watercolor illustrations suggest both the domestic and the historic dimensions of the tale while delighting the eye with tender greens, vibrant blues and palpable air. In the grand simplicity of Hutton's style, small detailsa clump of irises, a pair of dragonflies, some primitive toystake on a poignant importance, and by varying the scale the artist is equally able to portray the monumental and rather inhuman grandeur of Egyptian culture. The only quibble is that the text is so brief, the pages go by too quickly! Patricia Dooley, formerly at Drexel University, Philadelphia<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Hutton, who also has retold Jonah and the Great Fish and Noah and the Great Flood, here depicts the prophet's birth and miraculous escape from the pharoah's death decree. Baby Moses is set afloat among the bulrushes of the Nile, where waterfowl, sailing vessels and a hippopotamus pass by. The pharoah's daughter comes to bathe and discovers the infant, whom she pities. She hires Moses's real mother to nurse the baby, and then adopts him as her own. With its spare text and handsome watercolors, the book grants young children access to one of the world's oldest stories; details like chickens in the yard and a homely wooden cradle add a familiar, compelling touch. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Shade of Vampire 12: A Shade of Doubt : Volume 12</h2><p>&#34;Love.

Entitled "Secret Reich matter," it summarized the results of a meeting of top Nazi officials that took place on January 20, 1942, in a grand villa on the shore of Berlin's Lake Wannsee.<br><br>On one level, this document offered clarity: known as the Wannsee Protocol (and included here in full), it tallied up the Jews in Europe, carefully classified half and quarter Jews, and above all laid the groundwork for a "final solution to the Jewish Question." Yet the Protocol, among the most shameful documents in history, remains deeply mysterious. How can we understand this businesslike discussion of genocide? And why was the meeting necessary? Hundreds of thousands of Jews had already been shot in Russia or gassed in the camp at Chelmno. Test murders had been carried out in Auschwitz. Indeed, the most remarkable thing about the Wannsee Conference, is that we do not know why it took place.<br><br>Mark Roseman, author of the acclaimed <i>A Past in Hiding</i>, seeks to unravel this double mystery and to explain how it was that on a snowy January day in 1942, a group of educated young men met to discuss the systematic slaughter of a people.<br></p><p>Author of <i>A Past in Hiding</i> and winner of the Fraenkel Prize in contemporary history and Wingate Literary Prize for nonfiction, Mark Roseman teaches at the University of Southampton and has published widely on German history. He lives in Southampton, England.<br>"Roseman's book is a lively contribution to work on a terrifying period in history. It is no simplistic account--chaos and uncertainty are the very 'stuff' of history--but, throughout the book, we are forced to recognise the very ordinariness of these men as we follow, step by step, the diverse routes they followed in their will to destroy."&#x2014;Joanna Bourke, author of <i>The Second World War: A People's History, The New Statesman</i><br><br>"There is, to my knowledge, no book that brings together more masterfully in less than 200 pages the daunting problems and massive research on the Holocaust than Mark Roseman's account of the notorious Wannsee Conference. Concise and very accessible, yet also comprehensive in its contextualization of the 'Final Solution of the Jewish Question' and its origins, I found this a most illuminating study of the cold-blooded planning and execution of the most horrific crime of the twentieth century."&#x2014;V.R. Berghahn, Seth Low Professor of History, Columbia University<br><br>"A cool, judicious and well informed guide to the meeting whose minutes were described by the war crimes prosecutors at Nuremberg as 'perhaps the most shameful document of modern history.'"&#x2014;Richard J. Evans, author of <i>Lying About Hitler</i><br><br>"This is the best analysis in existence of the fateful Wannsee Conference and its place in the fateful events that culminated in 'The Final Solution.'"<br>&#x2014;Ian Kershaw, author of <i>Hitler </i><br><br>"Roseman's account is an excellent introduction to this immensely complex story . . . A highly-readable, concise and thorough account not only of the conference itself&#x2014;about which very little documentation ever survived&#x2014;but of the whole debate on the timing and nature of the Holocaust. Convincing."&#x2014;Richard Overy, author of Interrogations: The Nazi Elite in Allied Hands, in <i>The Sunday Telegraph </i>(London)<br><br>"Well-researched and subtly argued . . . Roseman's grasp of every detail of the Wannsee Conference is impressive . . . Equally important is the document translated here in full: the minutes of the meeting, known as the Wannsee Protocol . . . Roseman's book is also a contribution to the question of how far Hitler was personally responsible for the extermination program."&#x2014;Hyam Maccoby, <i>The Evening Standard</i> (London)<br><br>"An up-to-date analysis . . . Succinct, closely argued, free of academic jargon. Engrossing and chilling, it helps our understanding of Wannsee's place on the twisted path to genocide."&#x2014;Theo Richmond, author of<i> Konin: A Quest</i>, in <i>The Sunday Times</i> (London)<br><br>"Mark Roseman has succeeded in a brief 150 pages to write not one, but two standard works: one on Wannsee itself, the other on Germany's road to the Holocaust."&#x2014;<i>Berlin Tagespiegel</i><br></p><h2>A Sunless Sea: A William Monk Novel</h2><p>Anne Perry&#x2019;s spellbinding Victorian mysteries, especially those featuring William Monk, have enthralled readers for a generation. The <i>Plain Dealer</i> calls Monk &#x201c;a marvelously dark, brooding creation&#x201d;&#x2014;and, true to form, this new Perry masterpiece is as deceptively deep and twisty as the Thames.<br> &nbsp;<br> As commander of the River Police, Monk is accustomed to violent death, but the mutilated female body found on Limehouse Pier one chilly December morning moves him with horror and pity. The victim&#x2019;s name is Zenia Gadney. Her waterfront neighbors can tell him little&#x2014;only that the same unknown gentleman had visited her once a month for many years. She must be a prostitute, but&#x2014;described as quiet and kempt&#x2014;she doesn&#x2019;t appear to be a fallen woman.<br> &nbsp;<br> What sinister secrets could have made poor Zenia worth killing? And why does the government keep interfering in Monk&#x2019;s investigation?<br> &nbsp;<br> While the public cries out for blood, Monk, his spirited wife, Hester, and their brilliant barrister friend, Oliver Rathbone, search for answers. From dank waterfront alleys to London&#x2019;s fabulously wealthy West End, the three trail an ice-blooded murderer toward the unbelievable, possibly unprovable truth&#x2014;and ultimately engage their adversaries in an electric courtroom duel. But unless they can work a miracle, a monumental evil will go unpunished and an innocent person will hang.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anne Perry has never worn her literary colors with greater distinction than in <i>A Sunless Sea,</i> a heart-pounding novel of intrigue and suspense in which Monk is driven to make the hardest decision of his life.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>A Sunless Sea</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Anne Perry&#x2019;s Victorian mysteries are marvels.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;Unexpected twists and revelations keep the plot humming with typical Anne Perry deception and wit.&#x201d;&#x2014;Bookreporter<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Much more than a whodunit, this book [is] possibly the author&#x2019;s best yet.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly </i>(starred review)</p><p><b>Anne Perry</b> is the bestselling author of two acclaimed series set in Victorian England: the William Monk novels, including <i>Acceptable Loss</i> and <i>Execution Dock, </i>and the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels, including <i>Dorchester Terrace</i> and <i>Treason at Lisson Grove</i>.

The drops thrown from Monk&#x2019;s oars glowed momentarily in the air, like wine, or blood. On the other seat, a yard or so in front of him, Orme leaned forward and threw his weight against the drag of the current. They worked in perfect rhythm, used to each other now; it was the last week of November 1864, nearly two years since Monk had taken command of the Thames River Police at the Wapping Station.<br><br>That was a small victory for him. Orme had been part of the River Police all his adult life. For Monk it was a big adjustment after working first for the Metropolitan Police, and then for himself.<br><br>The peace of his satisfaction was shattered by a scream, which was piercing even above the creak of the oarlocks and the sound of the wash from a passing string of barges breaking on the shore. Monk and Orme both turned toward the north bank and Limehouse Pier, which was no more than twenty yards away.<br><br>The scream came again, shrill with terror, and suddenly a figure appeared, black against the shadowy outline of the sheds and warehouses on the embankment. It was someone in a long coat, waving their arms and stumbling around; it was impossible to tell whether it was a man or a woman.<br><br>With a glance over his shoulder at Monk, Orme dug his oars in again and swung the boat round toward the shore.<br><br>The low clouds were parting and the light became stronger; the figure materialized into a woman in a long skirt, standing on the pier, waving her arms and crying out to them, her words so jumbled in terror they were unintelligible.<br><br>The boat bumped at the steps and Orme tied it up.<br><br>Monk grasped the closest wooden beam and clambered out, going up the steps as fast as he could. When he got to the top he saw that the woman was now sobbing and putting her hands to her face as if to block out all possible vision.<br><br>Monk looked around. He could see no one else, nothing to cause such hysterical fear. Nor could he immediately see any evidence of a threat to the woman. The pier was empty except for her and Monk, and then Orme, coming up the steps.<br><br>Monk took her arm gently. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; he asked, his voice firm. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>She pulled away from him and swung round, jabbing her finger toward a heap of rubbish, which was slowly becoming more visible in the spreading morning light.<br><br>Monk walked over to it, his stomach clenching when he realized that what he had taken for torn canvas was actually the sodden skirt of a woman, her body so mutilated it was not instantly recognizable as human. There was no need to wonder if she was dead. She was twisted over, half on her back, her blue, sightless eyes turned up to the sky. Her hair was matted, and blood-�soaked at the back. But it was the rest of her body that made his gorge rise and choked the breath in his throat. Her belly was ripped open, and her entrails were torn out and laid like pale, skinless snakes across her loins.<br><br>Monk heard Orme&#x2019;s step behind him.<br><br>&#x201c;Dear God!&#x201d; Orme breathed out the words, not as a blasphemy but a cry for help, for what he saw not to be real.<br><br>Monk swallowed hard and grasped Orme&#x2019;s shoulder for a moment. Then, stumbling a little on the rough boards of the pier, he went back to the woman, who was now standing trembling uncontrollably.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know who she is?&#x201d; he said softly.<br><br>The woman shook her head, trying to push him away, but there was no strength in her. &#x201c;No! God &#x2019;elp me, I dunno &#x2019;er. I come lookin&#x2019; fer me man. Bastard&#x2019;s bin out all night! An&#x2019; I find &#x2019;er.&#x201d; She crossed herself as if to ward off the horror. &#x201c;I were terrified it were &#x2019;im, till I saw &#x2019;er, poor cow.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You found her just now, when you screamed?&#x201d; Monk asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. Ye&#x2019;re River Police, eh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br><br>She hesitated only a moment. With that thing lying on the boards, almost close enough to touch, perhaps the presence of the police was not such a bad thing as usual.<br><br>&#x201c;Ruby Jones.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where do you live, Mrs. Jones?&#x201d; Monk asked. &#x201c;And the truth, please. You don&#x2019;t want us coming looking for you, spreading your name up and down the riverside.&#x201d;<br><br>She looked at his eyes and decided he meant it. &#x201c;Northey Street, be&#x2019;ind the work&#x2019;ouse,&#x201d; she answered.<br><br>&#x201c;Look at her again, please,&#x201d; he said more gently. &#x201c;Look at her face. It&#x2019;s not too bad. Keep your eyes off the rest. Think if you&#x2019;ve seen her before.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t! I don&#x2019; know &#x2019;er!&#x201d; she repeated. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not lookin&#x2019; at that thing again. I&#x2019;m gonna see it the rest o&#x2019; me life!&#x201d;<br><br>He did not argue with her.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you just come down here, or were you waiting here for a while, maybe calling out for your man?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I were lookin&#x2019; fer &#x2019;im when I saw that. &#x2019;Ow long d&#x2019;yer think I&#x2019;m gonna stand &#x2019;ere, wi&#x2019; that beside me, eh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not very long,&#x201d; he agreed. &#x201c;Will you be all right to find your way home, Mrs. Jones?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; She jerked her arm sharply out of his grip. &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; She took a deep breath, then looked toward the body, the horror in her face replaced by pity for a moment. &#x201c;Poor cow,&#x201d; she repeated under her breath.<br><br>Monk let her go and turned to Orme. Together they went back to the corpse. Monk touched her face gently. The flesh was cold. He put a hand down to one of her shoulders, a little under the edge of her dress, feeling for any warmth at all. There was nothing. She had probably been dead all night.<br><br>Orme helped him turn her fully onto her back, completely exposing her ripped-�open belly with its pale entrails bulging out, slimy with blood.<br><br>Orme let out a gasp of horror and for a moment he swayed, even though he was used to corpses. He was familiar with the destruction that time and predators could cause to a body, but this was a barbarity inflicted by man, and it clearly shook him to a point where he could not hide his shock. He coughed, and seemed to choke on his own breath. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d better call the police surgeon, and the local station,&#x201d; he said hoarsely.<br><br>Monk nodded, swallowing hard. For a moment he had felt paralyzed with horror and pity. The river he was so used to seemed suddenly cold and strange. Familiar shapes of wharves and wooden piles jutting out of the water closed in on them, seeming threatening as the sharp dawn light distorted their proportions.<br><br>Orme&#x2019;s face was grim. &#x201c;Found her on the pier, means she&#x2019;s our case, sir,&#x201d; he said miserably. &#x201c;But of course land police may know who she is, poor creature. Could be this is domestic. Or, if she&#x2019;s a local prostitute, then perhaps we&#x2019;ve got a lunatic on our hands.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Either way we have a lunatic on our hands. Even if it was domestic, no sane man could do this to his wife,&#x201d; Monk said incredulously.<br><br>&#x201c;Who knows? Sometimes I think hate&#x2019;s worse than madness.&#x201d; Orme shook his head. &#x201c;The local station&#x2019;s up the street that way.&#x201d; He indicated with his arm. &#x201c;If you like, I&#x2019;ll stay here with her while you go get them, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>It was the sensible thing to do, since Monk was by far the senior of the two. Still, he was grateful, and said so. He had no wish to remain standing on the pier with the chill of the wind seeping into his bones, keeping watch over that dreadful corpse.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you. I&#x2019;ll be as quick as I can.&#x201d; He turned and walked rapidly across the pier itself, onto the bank and up toward the street. The sky was pale, the early sun silhouetting the wharves and warehouses. He passed half a dozen stevedores on their way to work. A lamplighter, little more than a gray shadow himself, reached his pole up and snuffed out the last lamp on the street.<br><br>An hour later, Monk and Orme were standing in the local police station, still shivering. There was a chill inside that even hot tea with whisky could not shift. Overstone, the police surgeon, came in, closing the door behind him. He was in his sixties, his gray hair thinning but his face keen. He looked from the local sergeant to Orme, then to Monk. He shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a bad one,&#x201d; he said very quietly. &#x201c;Most of the mutilation was almost certainly inflicted after death, perhaps all of it. Hard to be absolutely sure. If she wasn&#x2019;t dead already, that would have killed her. But there was still quite a lot of bleeding. She&#x2019;s been ripped open practically from navel to groin.&#x201d;<br><br>Monk looked at the man&#x2019;s strained face and saw the pity in his eyes. &#x201c;If she was dead when that happened, what killed her?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;The blow to the back of the head,&#x201d; Overstone replied. &#x201c;Single one. Hard enough to break her skull. Piece of lead pipe, I&#x2019;d say, or something like that.&#x201d;<br><br>He was standing by a wooden desk piled with papers of varying sizes, handwritten by many different people. There were neat bookshelves all around, the contents not stuffed back in place untidily like Monk&#x2019;s own. There were no pictures tacked up on the wall.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing else you can tell us?&#x201d; Monk asked without much hope.<br><br>Overstone&#x2019;s mouth turned down at the corners. &#x201c;Pretty vicious. Lot of weight behind the blow, but it could have been anybody between five and six foot tall.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Left hand? Right hand?&#x201d; Monk persisted.<br><br>&#x201c;Probably right-�handed, but could be either. Not much help,&#x201d; Overstone said apologetically. &#x201c;Most people are right-�handed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And the . . . mutilation?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Long blade: four or five inches, I&#x2019;d say. The cuts are deep, edges pretty sharp. Butcher&#x2019;s knife, sailor&#x2019;s knife&#x2014;�or sailmaker&#x2019;s, for that matter. For God&#x2019;s sake, man, half the chandlers, lightermen, or boatbuilders on the river have something that could have cut the poor woman open. Even a razor! Could be a barber, for that matter. Or any man who shaves himself.&#x201d; He seemed annoyed, as if his inability to narrow his answer stung him like some kind of guilt.<br><br>&#x201c;Or any housewife with a kitchen,&#x201d; the sergeant added.<br><br>Monk glanced at him.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, sir.&#x201d; The man lowered his eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;No need,&#x201d; Monk replied. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. Could be anyone at all.&#x201d; He turned to Overstone again. &#x201c;What about the woman herself? What can you tell me?&#x201d;<br><br>Overstone shrugged in a gesture of futility. &#x201c;Mid-�forties. Quite healthy, as far as I can tell at a quick examination,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;About five foot four. Fairish hair, bit of gray at the sides. Blue eyes, pleasant face but no remarkable features. Good teeth; I suppose that&#x2019;s unusual. Very white. Slight crossover at the front. I imagine when she smiled that might have been attractive.&#x201d; He looked down at the worn, wooden floor. &#x201c;Sometimes I hate this bloody job!&#x201d;<br><br>Then instantly he lifted his head and the moment&#x2019;s weakness was past. &#x201c;Might be able to say more tomorrow. One thing I can tell you now, with mutilation like this, feelings are going to run very high. As soon as word gets out there&#x2019;ll be fear, anger, then maybe panic. I don&#x2019;t envy you.&#x201d;<br><br>Monk turned to the sergeant. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d best keep it as quiet as you can,&#x201d; he ordered. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t give any details. The family doesn&#x2019;t need to know them, anyway. If she had one. Don&#x2019;t suppose anyone&#x2019;s been reported missing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; the sergeant replied unhappily. &#x201c;And we&#x2019;ll try.&#x201d; But his words lacked conviction.<br><br>Monk and Orme began near Limehouse Pier and worked along the stretch of Narrow Street, north and south, asking everyone they passed, or in the shops now open, if they had seen anyone going toward the pier the previous evening. Did they know anyone who would return home that way after work, or prostitutes who might seek customers in the area?<br><br>The description of the woman was too general for the police to try to identify her: average height, fair brown hair, blue eyes. And it was too early for anyone to be considered missing.<br><br>They were told of several prostitutes, even one or two people who liked to walk that route, as Narrow Street offered a pleasant view of the river in places. They gathered a dozen names.<br><br>They moved inland up the alleys to Northey Street, Orme in one direction, Monk the other, asking the same questions. It was cold, but the wind had dropped and there was no rain. The low winter sun held no heat.<br><br>Monk was walking along the footpath in Ropemakers Fields when a small woman in gray came out of a door carrying a bundle of laundry balanced on her hip. Monk stopped almost in front of her.<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me, do you live here?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>She looked him up and down suspiciously. He was dressed in his usual dark, plain clothes, like those a waterman might wear, but the cut was far better, as if a tailor had made them rather than a chandler. His speech was precise, his voice gentle, and he stood with both grace and confidence.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah . . . ,&#x201d; she said guardedly. &#x201c; &#x2019;Oo are yer as wants ter know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Commander Monk of the River Police,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for anyone who might have heard a fight last night, a woman screaming, perhaps a man shouting at her.&#x201d;<br><br>She sighed and rolled her eyes wearily. &#x201c;If I ever &#x2019;ave a night when I don&#x2019;t &#x2019;ear nobody fighting I&#x2019;ll tell yer. In fact, I&#x2019;ll tell the bleedin&#x2019; newspapers. Now, if yer don&#x2019;t mind, I got work ter do.&#x201d; She pushed her hair out of her eyes and with an irritable gesture began to move past him.<br><br>Monk stepped sideways to block her way. &#x201c;This wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary fight. The woman was killed. Probably an hour or two after dark, on Limehouse Pier.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wot kind of woman?&#x201d; she asked him, her face suddenly frightened, mouth drawn tight with a new anxiety.<br><br>&#x201c;About forty or so,&#x201d; he replied. He saw her face relax. He guessed she had daughters who passed that way, possibly even stood around gossiping or flirting. &#x201c;She was an inch or two taller than you, fair hair with a little gray in it. Quite pretty, in a quiet way.&#x201d; He remembered the teeth. &#x201c;Probably a nice smile.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dunno,&#x201d; the woman with the laundry answered. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t sound like no one as I ever seen. Yer sure she were forty, like?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. And she was wearing ordinary clothes, not like a woman looking for business,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;And there was no paint on her face that we could see.&#x201d; He felt callous speaking of her like that. He had robbed her of character, of humor or dreams, likes and dislikes; probably because he wanted to rob her also of her terror. Please God, she did not know what had happened to her afterward. He hoped she had not even seen the blade.<br><br>&#x201c;Then &#x2019;er &#x2019;usband done &#x2019;er in,&#x201d; the woman replied, pulling an expression of weary grief. &#x201c;But I dunno &#x2019;oo she is. Could be anyone.&#x201d; She pushed a few trailing hairs back off her face again and adjusted the weight of the laundry bag on her hip.<br><br>Monk thanked her and moved on. He stopped other people, both men and women, asking the same questions and getting more or less the same answers. No one recognized the woman from Monk&#x2019;s description of her. No one admitted to being anywhere near Limehouse Pier after dark, which at this time of the year was about five o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon. The evening had been overcast and damp. Little work was possible after that. No one had heard shouting or anything that sounded like a fight.

The new edition contains all of the original text. Expanded content includes photographs and separately appended material that fills out the Donohue story in words and pictures and provides historical context. </p><p>The Unfair Advantage captures a uniquely American blend of intellect and scrappiness. A graduate in engineering from Brown University, Donohue integrated creativity, openness to new ideas, humor, and his persistent will to win into every part of his approach to racing. </p><p>When Donohue puts that formula into words in The Unfair Advantage the result is as much an attitude and perspective as anything else. As such, it has had wide reaching and particularly personal impact for almost 30 years in the world of motorsport participants and enthusiasts.</p></p><p>Mark Donohue gained fame in the '60s and '70s as a maverick breed of auto racer who used scientific and engineering skill to win his races. From winning amateur races in his college days as a mechanical engineering student at Brown to taking the checkered flag at the 1972 Indianapolis 500, Mark Donohue strove to understand the dynamics behind high performance, and then perfected his skill in extracting it.He also was a winning co-driver of the 24-hour sports car enduro at Daytona, and he set a world's speed record at Talladega. <p>Of course, racing has been called "the cruel sport;" Mark suffered many losses and disappointments too, both public and private. His life ended tragically at the age of 38 after a 1975 Formula One accident in Austria. But his legacy remains timeless. In fact, every successful driver today owes a debt of knowledge to Mark Donohue's pioneering work in applying science to speed.</p>...Donohue's book is a must-read. -- <i>LA Car, December 2000</i><br><br>...a gripping history of sports cars and road racing. -- <i>Los Angeles Times, December 6, 2000</i><br><br>...must-read titles. -- <i>AutoWeek, November 20-26, 2000</i><br><br>...the return of The Unfair Advantage means everything good -- <i>Excellence, April 2001</i><br><br>Bentley Publishing brings back a book to introduce a singular American motorsports hero to a new generation of racing fans. -- <i>Roundel, February 2001</i><br><br>Donohue tells . . . the story of how racing became a science as well as a sport. -- <i>Automobile, February 2001</i><br><br>Donohue's storytelling evokes a time when modestly funded (and talented) guys made good. -- <i>Sports Car Market, November 2000</i><br><br>Highly recommended. -- <i>911 &amp; Porsche World, December 2000</i><br><br>Several car books have been released recently, and one that really caught our eye is The Unfair Advantage... -- <i>Grassroots Motorsports, December 2000</i><br><br>The 25th anniversary edition of The Unfair Advantage brings back the long-sought-after title and adds more than 100 new photos -- <i>Hot Rod, January 2001</i></p><h2>Book of Three</h2><p><i>Taran, The Assistant Pig-Keeper</i>, longs to be a hero.<br>He begins his journey with a strange assortment of companions on a dangerous mission to save his beloved land, Prydain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Packed with action, humor, romance, and gallantry, Taran's adventures chronicle his beloved Prydain and his battle with the forces of evil.</p><p>The tale of Taran, assistant pig keeper, has been entertaining young readers for generations. Set in the mythical land of Prydain (which bears a more than passing resemblance to Wales), Lloyd Alexander's book draws together the elements of the hero's journey from unformed boy to courageous young man. Taran grumbles with frustration at home in the hamlet Caer Dallben; he yearns to go into battle like his hero, Prince Gwydion. Before the story is over, he has met his hero and fought the evil leader who threatens the peace of Prydain: the Horned King. <p> What brings the tale of Taran to life is Alexander's skillful use of humor, and the way he personalizes the mythology he has so clearly studied. Taran isn't a stick figure; in fact, the author makes a point of mocking him just at the moments when he's acting the most highhanded and heroic. When he and the young girl Eilonwy flee the castle of the wicked queen Achren, Taran emotes, "'Spiral Castle has brought me only grief; I have no wish to see it again.' 'What has it brought the rest of us?' Eilonway asked. 'You make it sound as though we were just sitting around having a splendid time while you moan and take on.'" By the end, Alexander has spun a rousing hero's tale and created a compelling coming-of-age story. Readers will sigh with relief when they realize <i>The Book of Three</i> is only the first of the chronicles of Prydain. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>Taran dreams of adventure, but nothing exciting ever happens to an Assistant Pig-Keeper--until his pig runs away. A chase through the woods leads Taran far from home and into great danger, for evil prowls the land of Prydain. With a collection of strange and wonderful friends whom he meets on his journey, Taran finds himself fighting so that good may triumph over evil--and so that his beloved home will not fall to a diabolical fiend.</p><h2>The Plateau</h2><p><b><b>During World War II, French villagers offered safe harbor to countless strangers - mostly children - as they fled for their lives. The same place offers refuge to migrants today. Why?</b></b><br><br>In a remote pocket of Nazi-held France, ordinary people risked their lives to rescue many hundreds of strangers, mostly Jewish children. Was this a fluke of history, or something more? Anthropologist Maggie Paxson, certainties shaken by years of studying strife, arrives on the Plateau to explore this phenomenon: What are the traits that make a group choose selflessness? <br><br>In this beautiful, wind-blown place, Paxson discovers a tradition of offering refuge that dates back centuries. But it is the story of a distant relative that provides the beacon for which she has been searching. Restless and idealistic, Daniel Trocm� had found a life of meaning and purpose--or it found him--sheltering a group of children on the Plateau, until the Holocaust came for him, too. Paxson's journey into past and present turns up new answers, new questions, and a renewed faith in the possibilities for us all, in an age when global conflict has set millions adrift. Riveting, multilayered, and intensely personal, <i>The Plateau</i> is a deeply inspiring journey into the central conundrum of our time.</p><p><b>Maggie Paxson </b>is a writer, anthropologist, and performer. She is the author of<i> Solovyovo: The Story of Memory in a Russian Village</i>, and her essays have appeared in <i>The Washington Post Magazine</i>,<i> The Wilson Quarterly, </i>and <i>Aeon</i>. Fluent in Russian and French, she has worked in rural communities in northern Russia, the Caucasus, and upland France.<p>Chapter 1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unanswered</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</p><p>&#x2014;Daniel 7:15</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let's just say that suddenly you are a social scientist and you want to study peace. That is, you want to understand what makes for a peaceful society. Let's say that, for years in your work in various parts of the world, you've been surrounded by evidence of violence and war. From individual people, you've heard about beatings and arrests and murders and rapes; you've heard about deportations and black-masked men demanding people's food or their lives. You've heard about family violence and village violence and state violence. You've heard these stories from old women with loose, liquid tears; from young men with arms full of prison tattoos.</p><p>There were men on horseback calling the boys to war, and long black cars arriving to steal people away in the dead of night; girls who'd wandered the landscape, insane after sexual violations; there was the survival of the fittest in concentration camps; there were pregnant women beaten until their children were lost and bodies piled up in times of famine; there was arrest and exile for the theft of a turnip; there were those who were battered for being a Jew or a Christian or a Muslim or a Bah&#x2021;'&#x2019;.</p><p>Let's say that, in the world of ideas that swirled around you, approximations were made of how to make sense of this mess: the presence of certain kinds of states; the presence of certain kinds of social diversity; the presence of certain kinds of religion. And let's say that the shattering stories had piled on over the years until, at some point, you just snapped. You wanted to study war no more.</p><p>As it turns out, it's harder to study peace than you might think.</p><p>Or it has been for me. I'm an anthropologist who spent years living among country people-mostly in a couple of tiny villages in Russia-asking basic questions about how memory works in groups. I had some ideas about how I might start a search for peace. After all, even though the stories of violence were many, for the most part people seemed occupied with other things: They worked in kitchens or fields, hauled water, made decisions about what to do based on the weather, ate with guests, cleaned up after livestock. Even if they bristled sometimes, people generally faced each other day to day with working problems and working solutions. There was love and there were revelries and heartbreaks. And in spite of what they'd seen in life, or what their very own hands might have wrought on their worst days, people saw themselves as basically decent, and expected basic decency back from the world.</p><p>Surely, there had to be ways of looking for that kind of eye-to-eye decency. Surely, there were ways to study its power and its limits, particularly when people were faced with tempestuous times. Were there communities out there that were good at being good when things got bad? In my research on memory, I'd studied practices of resistance and persistence. Could there be communities that were somehow resistant to violence, persistent in decency? I didn't know exactly what I was on to, but I knew I wanted to study it. In shorthand, I called it peace.</p><p>But peace was hard to find. I dug into contemporary scholarship in anthropology, sociology, and political science; I went through databases and bibliographies and talked to colleagues who had been in the trenches with me in the study of a tumultuous Eurasia, and to other colleagues in peace studies programs or peace institutes. What I found was this: There is vastly more contemporary social science on violence than there is on peace. And most contemporary empirical research that says it is about peace is really about conflict. About resolving conflict, cleaning up after conflict, about programs to bring aid to people in conflict settings. About law and justice within the context of conflict. On the whole, these literatures are about peace only insofar as they point to the suffering of millions, and lament.&nbsp;</p><p>This kind of work is important, but it wasn't what I was looking for. I wanted social science that landed smack on the inside of peaceful societies and studied human interactions at ground level there, distilling something about how peace works in its tight mechanics. I wanted empirical research that regarded the social body up close and asked about its long-term health and stability; research that asked how, in hard times, regular decency can sometimes translate into extraordinary kindness. Here and there I found brilliant examples of work like this, but strikingly few of them.</p><p>Why, I began to wonder, is peace so hard to think about? Or conversely, why is violence so easy?</p><p>When writers and academics talk about violence, it can seem to have a "thingness," to stand out from the background. It can be counted (a shot, an explosion, a bullet, a death), or so we believe. It can be added up and placed into data sets. In the aggregate, and with a measure of confidence, political scientists can fit violent acts into models, which they use to make statements about the world. Violence happens: a gun goes off; a person is killed; a neighborhood is raided; a border is breached. The n is large here; the data take shape. We can decide that more violence happens, say, when there are more young men than usual, or when there is a weak state, or mountains, or too much petrol in an economy. Violence happens, and it is awful, and it is counted; and from that counting, the contours of probable outcomes are given a local habitation and a name.</p><p>But can peace be counted? Where is it located? When does it happen? Peace lacks this analyzable "thingness": It seems like a non-event, a null set. Characterizations of peace and peaceful societies-from the Eden of the Bible to the "radiant future" of Lenin-look dull and flat, or else gauzy and kitsch. As a child, I would leaf through The Children's Illustrated Bible in the dentist's waiting room. In the Eden of those illustrations, religious peace looks like the beatific expressions of light-skinned people gazing heavenward. Perhaps a lamb sits there, too, legs folded, under a tree. Peace is bland and blond, utterly lacking the dark ring of truth.</p><p>The political peace of Marx and other visionaries of the nineteenth century is not much easier to make out. In the end, at any rate in Marx's version, it looks like getting to hunt and fish when you want and passing around the milk can so everyone gets a fair share. It's the end of history there, in the land of peace at the end of time, after the wars have all been fought and all the blood is shed. On the subject of capitalism, Marx was keen-eyed, detail-oriented, and extremely voluble. But when it came to imagining communism in practice, he, too, reverted, in effect, to lambs, legs folded, under a tree.</p><p>In these visions, peace is a thing only to the extent that it is an impenetrable, immovable, unchanging thing. There is a long philosophical history to this line of thinking, but the gist-with a nod to Descartes and his venerable method-is this: Some stuff (the physical world) is amenable to science and scientific law, while other stuff (poetry, theology, the matter of emotion) just isn't. Peace-a place where nothing ever happens-can't, in our easy thinking, be divided up at all. And if it can't be divided, it can't be studied; only felt. That's a terrible shame. After all, what could be more important than the actual content of peace? What could be more useful, when you look into the eyes of individual people who have faced violence right up close, than to have some understanding of what kind of effort peace might take? Of what ingenious (or even banal) habits it depends upon?</p><p>It's worth trying, no?</p><p>What if we began by regarding peace not as timeless, but as dynamic; not located in the beginning or the end, but in the unfolding; something not of the ether, but of lived grounds and interactions; something not perfect but flawed and rough-grained? Social science can handle that. It can handle dynamics, can look toward the longue dur e, settling happily into the study of actual, imperfect behavior. That kind of research requires no calls to the angels or to Elysium. You just look into the faces of real people and the connections they make or don't make with each other, the stories they tell or don't tell, and the ways they decide or don't decide to treat a stranger as one of their own.</p><p>If peace can be this-defined within a regular, real kind of social world-how, then, would you know a peaceful community when you saw one?</p><p>A lack of violence would be a good start, of course-though this is a definition in the negative, like defining health in terms of the absence of illness, and not as the brilliant sum of systems that preserve the spark of life. Still, it's useful. Some recent research on social networks seems to show that violence is less likely when there are deep and common contacts between communities. It also seems that societies where girls are educated are less likely to be violent. In some warring parts of the world, it is possible to identify-and count and describe-specific communities that somehow manage to avoid the scourge of war and become, in effect, "peace enclaves." Little by little, with the help of data, we can begin to pinpoint places in the world where violence goes down and down-perhaps, someday, all the way to zero. And this is an excellent start.</p><p>Still, for me, the close-up is necessary. What is peace, face-to-face, even as war rages all around? You should be able to find it, in how a community solves even its small problems; how it handles inequality and sharing; how it defines and deals with diversities; how it makes a habit of protecting the vulnerable in troubled times; how some behaviors become, in effect, unthinkable within it.</p><p>If you want to study peace, face-to-face, you need to find peaceful faces. And you need to have a plan. And you need to start counting things, maybe, but the right things.</p><p>Above all, you need an example.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have an aunt, Barbara, who sends me things-mostly little family keepsakes and her own artwork. Years ago, she sent me a book that arrived smelling of old wood and tin. That book, Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed, by Philip Hallie, seemed special-and my aunt said that our family was somehow connected to its story-but I didn�t read it right away.</p><p>Then one day-after many travels and many adventures, and many hours contemplating the meaning of violence I had learned of up close&#x2014;</p><p>I did.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a remarkable story, set on a tiny plateau in south-central France called Vivarais-Lignon. From 1939 to 1945, the people of Vivarais-Lignon took in hundreds if not thousands of strangers who had been doomed by the Nazi occupation of the Second World War. They were farmers, tradesmen, clergy, teachers, and politicians-and despite terrifying conditions all around, they fed the strangers, hid them, schooled them, and eventually ferried them off to safety in Switzerland. The rescuers were in constant mortal danger. And indeed, some villagers were punished by the German occupiers and the collaborating French police. Some were killed.</p><p>How many people-as a collective, no less-would do this? How many would gird themselves for the mortal haul? And how many, in the face of the daily pressure to go with the forces of the blood-dimmed tide, would resist? These people, tested by fire, landed far on the end of the bell curve drawn by "rational choice." So rare was their shared effort during the Holocaust that the community of Vivarais-Lignon is one of only two to be singled out by Israel's Yad Vashem for memorialization in its Garden of the Righteous Among the Nations.&nbsp;</p><p>Was their effort during the Holocaust a brilliant fluke-or something more, some deeper reflection of their social practice? Hard to say, but there is this: It turns out that for hundreds of years-from the time of the first religious wars in France, through revolutions, colonial wars, and the fascist and nationalist conflagrations of broader Europe-the community of Vivarais-Lignon has been, on and off, actively sheltering vulnerable peoples in violent times. So perhaps the people living in this high plateau do know things that we don't. Perhaps we can learn them.</p><p>And so, having found an example of a place on the end of the bell curve, a place where common decency seemed to have become uncommon decency, I began to hold this example up like a precious stone, its structure a crystalline mystery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One day, I decided to hitch a ride with friends to Washington, D.C., to visit the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, which promised to take me down into the depths of the story that was drawing me forward.</p><p>The museum's interior is a marvel of evocation: You enter into the rust-gray walls of an elevator. As the doors open, the story begins, as it will end, in darkness. Right away, there are images of skeletal human beings looking straight into the camera-one man, bald and in rags, holding a metal bowl-and corpses on train tracks, in Buchenwald and Dachau. Then you walk, in the dark, toward the story of the rise of Nazism. Photographs of men with swastika armbands; of muzzled dogs, eye-high and ready for attack. Songs that, even if you don't know German, sound like the melody of a nation careening toward its moral end. Down the hall, you see posters from the 1930s that explain the Nuremberg Laws, using little stick silhouettes in white (for Aryan), black (for Jew), and gray (for somewhere in between). And then, artifacts of that era's hair samples, and eye-color testers, and metal instruments invented to assess the size of a forehead, a nose, or a skull-all to determine the hidden presence of a Jew. Here, up close, is the science of race in all its Weimar glory-early anthropology's poisoned fruit.</p><p>I wound my own way through the exhibit, feeling my hand brush up against the railing from time to time in the dark. The war years passed like the ticking of a great, unstoppable clock. Tick. 1938: Kristallnacht. Jews race over borders, smuggle themselves onto ships, fleeing as they can. Tick. 1939: The German army-eager to increase the Lebensraum for the Aryans of the Third Reich-gobbles portions of the Czech lands and Poland, and Jews are sent to ghettos. Tick. Spring of 1940: France falls. Tick. 1941: Germany advances its armies eastward toward Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, followed quickly by elite mobile killing units called Einsatzgruppen. Village by village, SS soldiers aim guns at locals together with the question, "Where are your Jews?" and the goal: to gather, shoot, and kill them all. Tick. Tick.

Par la suite, il a �t� professeur en �lectricit� et �lectronique aupr�s d'un organisme gouvernemental, soit le Centre de Main-d'&#x153;uvre du Canada (CMC) et aussi formateur en entreprise priv�e. Il a toujours montr� un vif int�r�t pour la communication sous toutes ses formes. Apr�s avoir termin� ses �tudes universitaires, les m�dias �lectroniques attirent son attention&nbsp;et il entreprend en 1977 une formation au Coll�ge des Annonceurs en Radio et T�l�vision (CART) du Qu�bec. Son d�sir de comprendre �&nbsp;l'autre c�t� des choses&nbsp;� le conduit dans une qu�te spirituelle qui r�oriente compl�tement sa vie. C'est en 1988 qu'il commence une formation en d�veloppement personnel. Cette formation le touche � un tel point qu'il devient animateur d'ateliers de d�veloppement personnel, emploi qu'il occupera ensuite � plein temps, d�s 1990, en tant que psychoth�rapeute. Riche de �&nbsp;V�rit�s&nbsp;�, le communicateur en lui choisit de partager le fruit de ses r�flexions. Ainsi, le "Centre de Croissance ATMA " verra le jour en 1990, pour devenir &nbsp;ATMA Inc. &nbsp;en 1996. Jacques Martel en assume encore la pr�sidence. En 1991, un projet d'�criture prend place dans sa vie. S�rement, le livre&nbsp;Le grand dictionnaire des malaises et maladies&nbsp;se pr�pare&nbsp;� voir le jour. Les connaissances que Jacques a acquises durant sa formation d'ing�nieur �lectricien lui ont permis de &nbsp;voyager du tangible � l'intangible, de la pratique � l'intuition; de m�me, ses nombreux ateliers&nbsp;et conf�rences lui ont confirm� le lien �troit entre la maladie et la pens�e (sentiments et �motions...) comme source de conflit pouvant conduire au d�clenchement des maladies.&nbsp;Le voici donc fin pr�t � �crire son livre qui verra finalement le jour en avril 1998. En 1993, il devient&nbsp;Ma�tre REIKI&nbsp;(technique de gu�rison �nerg�tique). C'est en 1995 qu'il acquiert sa formation de Rebirtheur. De 1994 � 1998, il est pr�sident de �&nbsp;l'Association Canadienne et Qu�b�coise des Ma�tres REIKI&nbsp;� &nbsp;(ACQMR). En 2011, il est form� en Reconnexion� (une autre technique de gu�rison �nerg�tique). Depuis le 04/04/04 (4 avril 2004),&nbsp; il est devenu plus conscient de la Voie � suivre pour d�velopper davantage de moyens pour aller vers la gu�rison physique, �motionnelle, mentale et spirituelle.

In&nbsp;<i>I Myself have Seen It,</i>&nbsp;she proves the mystery, beauty, and myth of her native islands to be every bit as compelling as her fiction. She interweaves her own memories of growing up in Honolulu in the 1950s and '60s with a concise chronicle of Hawaii's two-hundred-year encounter with the West. Seeking the elusive heart of Hawaii, Moore revisits the small rural island of Kauai. In the breathtaking landscape, she discovers that old, unwritten songs of Polynesia have survived despite the onslaught of missionaries in the early 18th century, the establishment of Hawaiian-language newspapers, and foreign attempts to free Hawaiians of their pagan superstitions. These songs and the ones engendered by them, written by queens and hula masters alike, become the centerpiece for Moore's mesmerizing discovery of the real Hawaii.</p><p>Susanna Moore was raised in Hawaii and now lives in New York City. She is the author of <i>The Whiteness of Bones, Sleeping Beauties, </i>and <i>In the Cut.</i>&nbsp;<i>My Old Sweetheart, </i>her first novel, won the PEN/Ernest Hemingway Citation and the Sue Kaufman Prize from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.This deliciously satisfying travel memoir... lets you taste what is really [in Hawaii] beyond tourist traps [and] cellophane garlands. -- <i>Newsday, May 18, 2003</i></p><h2>Deadball Stars of the National League: The Society for American Baseball Research (Photographic Histories)</h2><p>This new volume is the first book establishing a relationship between Brassey&#x2019;s, Inc. and the premier research organization in all of sports, the Society for American Baseball Research.

C. Beaton</b> was born in Scotland. She worked for many years as a journalist on Fleet Street. As well as the bestselling 'Agatha Raisin' series, she is the author of the acclaimed 'Hamish Macbeth' mysteries. She divides her time between the Cotswolds, where she lives in a village very much like Agatha's beloved Carsely, and Paris.Hamish Macbeth, one-man police force of Lochdubh village in the Scottish Highlands, is in trouble again (Death of a Nag, 1995, etc.), with archenemy Chief Inspector Blair still trying to orchestrate his downfall. For some time, the village has been home to one Randy Duggan, nicknamed Macho Man, whose past is mysterious and who regales the bar regulars with tales of his wrestling triumphs--his massive fists ready for action at the slightest provocation. Hamish has accepted his challenge to a fight (strictly against regulations), and the whole village comes out to watch. When Duggan fails to show, it's fisherman Archie MacLean who finds him in his cottage--hands bound, shot to death. Hamish does his best to scout Duggan's true identity and questions the villagers who had close contact with him, as well as the newcomer Rosie Draly, a romance author rumored to be writing a detective story. Days after that interview, Hamish finds Draly stabbed to death, her computer disks destroyed. Draly's killer is soon nailed, thanks to Hamish's persistence in tracking the evidence, and confesses to Duggan's murder as well. The police brass are satisfied but not Hamish. He carries on his own investigation in disguise, going all the way to Glasgow, where he finds another corpse; commandeers a civilian plane back to Lochdubh; and arrives just in time to save the life of sometime girlfriend Priscilla Halburton-Smythe, and to wind up the case--his way. The rambling, shambling plot has some suspenseful patches; Lochdubh's locals are as entertaining as ever; and Hamish is at his charming, exasperating best. Mid-level Beaton, and that's not bad. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i></p><h2>Tired or Toxic? A Blueprint for Health</h2><p>Book title: TIRED OR TOXIC?

She calls the church to embrace, rather than ignore, its difficulties and find different ways of doing outreach.<br><br>Heath brings a fresh perspective to the theory and practice of evangelism by approaching it through contemplative spirituality. By looking to mystics, saints, and martyrs of church history--such as Ignatius of Loyola, Julian of Norwich, St. Francis, John Wesley, Mother Theresa, and Henri Nouwen--she suggests we can discover ways of thinking about God that result in a life of outreach.</p><p>Elaine Heath argues that the church is in a dark night of the soul. It has thus lost its prophetic voice--its effectiveness in proclaiming the good news of redemption. Rather than resisting or decrying this state of affairs, the church, says Heath, ought to embrace its situation as a starting point to renew its vitality and consequently, its witness. A solution is proposed in the wisdom and contemplative spirituality of the great saints and mystics--people such as Julian of Norwich, Ignatius of Loyola, Phoebe Palmer, Henri Nouwen, and others.<br><br>This book brings fresh insights to the theory and practice of evangelism by examining it through the lens of the classic threefold path of purgation, illumination, and union. Different ways of thinking about evangelism are drawn from the lives and teachings of the mystics, and different ways of practicing evangelism are then proposed via narrative theology. The result is a holistic perspective, offering a corrective to programmatic and consumeristic forms of evangelism so prevalent today. Here is a unique contribution to the discussion on evangelism in our postmodern world.<br><br>"A refreshing and profound contribution. With perceptive insight, Heath identifies issues facing the contemporary church in the West. She then responds to those issues with care and creativity, skillfully recovering the richness of Christian mysticism and its themes of holiness. Not many projects ably bridge the distance that can emerge between the study of evangelism and its practice in communities of faith--Heath's does."--<b>Laceye Warner</b>, Duke University Divinity School<br><br>"Elaine Heath is not afraid to name our demons and release our angels! She shows courage, honesty, and direction for the future in this very readable book.

But work she does. Hard, too. <i>And you hardly know it.</i>&#x201d; So read the text of a 1969 newspaper advertisement for Delta Airlines featuring a picture of a brightly smiling blond stewardess striding confidently down the aisle of an airplane cabin to deliver a meal. <p></p><p>From the moment the first stewardesses took flight in 1930, flight attendants became glamorous icons of femininity. For decades, airlines hired only young, attractive, unmarried white women. They marketed passenger service aloft as an essentially feminine exercise in exuding charm, looking fabulous, and providing comfort. The actual work that flight attendants did&#x2014;ensuring passenger safety, assuaging fears, serving food and drinks, all while conforming to airlines&#x2019; strict rules about appearance&#x2014;was supposed to appear effortless; the better that stewardesses performed by airline standards, the more hidden were their skills and labor. Yet today flight attendants are acknowledged safety experts; they have their own unions. Gone are the no-marriage rules, the mandates to retire by thirty-two. In <i>Femininity in Flight</i>, Kathleen M. Barry tells the history of flight attendants, tracing the evolution of their glamorized image as ideal women and their activism as trade unionists and feminists.</p><p>Barry argues that largely because their glamour obscured their labor, flight attendants unionized in the late 1940s and 1950s to demand recognition and respect as workers and self-styled professionals. In the 1960s and 1970s, flight attendants were one of the first groups to take advantage of new laws prohibiting sex discrimination. Their challenges to airlines&#x2019; restrictive employment policies and exploitive marketing practices (involving skimpy uniforms and provocative slogans such as &#x201c;fly me&#x201d;) made them high-profile critics of the cultural mystification and economic devaluing of &#x201c;women&#x2019;s work.&#x201d; Barry combines attention to the political economy and technology of the airline industry with perceptive readings of popular culture, newspapers, industry publications, and first-person accounts. In so doing, she provides a potent mix of social and cultural history and a major contribution to the history of women&#x2019;s work and working women&#x2019;s activism.</p></p><p>"Femininity in Flight is outstanding. It is the most thoroughly presented book on femininity, work, and pink-collar activism to date. It expands the contours of the women's rights movement and complicates the grounds on which women make demands for better working conditions."-- Eileen Boris, author of Home to Work: Motherhood and the Politics of Industrial Homework in the United States <p>"Femininity in Flight is the first book that tells the story of the flight attendant occupation as a whole and gives us the history of the occupation in so compelling and rich a fashion. Kathleen M. Barry offers us an entertaining and witty account of how flight attendants embodied changing notions of femininity, and then she boldly challenges conventional wisdom by arguing that it was those very cultural constraints that in part spurred flight attendant activism."-- Dorothy Sue Cobble, author of The Other Women's Movement: Workplace Justice and Social Rights in Modern America</p>&#34;&#34;Femininity in Flight&#34; is the first book that tells the story of the flight attendant occupation as a whole and gives us the history of the occupation in so compelling and rich a fashion.

But it was economically and militarily weak and its misguided offensive to liberate the Ukraine in the spring of 1920 laid it open to attack. Egged on by Trotsky, Lenin launched a massive westward advance under the flamboyant Marshal Tukhachevsky.</p> <p>All that Great Britain and France had fought for over four years now seemed at risk. By the middle of August the Russians were only a few kilometres from Warsaw, and Berlin was less than a week's march away. Then occurred the 'Miracle of the Vistula': the Polish army led by Jozef Pilsudski regrouped and achieved one of the most decisive victories in military history.</p> <p>As a result, the Versailles peace settlement survived, and Lenin was forced to settle for Communism in one country. The battle for Warsaw bought Europe nearly two decades of peace, and communism remained a mainly Russian phenomenon, subsuming many of the autocratic and Byzantine characteristics of Russia's tsarist tradition.</p></p><p><p>Adam Zamoyski was born in New York, was educated at Oxford, and lives in London.

Whatever normal is.</p><p>The movie or TV show I&#x2019;m watching features a sexy scene: a man and woman in a clinch, their lips silhouettes that almost touch. A ballad by Dinah Washington comes up on shuffle, raw and yearning. Hugh Jackman shows up shirtless on the cover of a supermarket magazine. The usual things get me started, I guess.</p><p>So then I&#x2019;m in my boyfriend&#x2019;s bed (when I have a boyfriend) or alone between the sheets, or in the shower (when I don&#x2019;t). I close my eyes. I try to forget everything except the pulsing between my legs, the pressure and rhythm that&#x2019;s making my pulse race. The images in my mind jumble together, without narrative or emotion or sense&#x2014;like a pornographic kaleidoscope of tongues and lips, cock and cunt, the heat of skin on skin. Usually I start to moan; I&#x2019;m not one of the quiet ones. So far, so good.</p><p>But no matter how explicit and erotic the kaleidoscope gets, no matter how talented the guy&#x2019;s tongue is, or how constant my hand&#x2019;s pressure might be&#x2014;it never, ever gets me off.</p><p>Only one fantasy does that.</p><p>I try not to think about it. I tell myself it&#x2019;s sick, it&#x2019;s wrong. A lot of times, when I&#x2019;m with a guy, I just don&#x2019;t come. It&#x2019;s embarrassing to be this good at faking it.</p><p>When I&#x2019;m alone&#x2014;or when I&#x2019;m with a lover and I want to get off <i>so bad</i> that I can&#x2019;t take it anymore&#x2014;I have to go there.</p><p>In my mind, ropes wind around my wrists, my ankles. Or I&#x2019;m rolled onto my stomach, hands pinned behind my back. Sometimes I&#x2019;m blindfolded. Sometimes he makes me look at him. If I&#x2019;m going down on a guy, I ask him to pull my hair, and the whole time I&#x2019;m pretending that he&#x2019;s making me do this. Forcing me. In reality he says, <i>Baby</i> or <i>You&#x2019;re beautiful</i>; I imagine him saying, <i>Whore. Suck it, you cunt.</i></p><p>I don&#x2019;t get off unless I&#x2019;m imagining being raped.</p><p>Sometimes it&#x2019;s &#x201c;softer&#x201d;&#x2014;a guy backing me against a wall at a party, or taking advantage when I&#x2019;m sloppy drunk. Other times it&#x2019;s brutal. Tied down spread-eagled. Or in a ditch on my hands and knees.</p><p>At least I don&#x2019;t fantasize about weapons at my throat, or pointed at my head. Not yet, anyway.</p><p>I hate this about myself. I <i>hate</i> it. I&#x2019;ve tried to change so many times; I&#x2019;ve always failed. While I wish I could say I don&#x2019;t know why I&#x2019;m wired this way&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I do.</p><p>Maybe it doesn&#x2019;t matter. Lots of people have sexual fantasies they&#x2019;d never act on, whether they&#x2019;re violent or perverse, silly or flat-out biologically impossible. If it&#x2019;s all in my head, and it makes me come, what&#x2019;s the harm?</p><p>(It makes me come <i>hard</i>.)</p><p>The harm is when the lines between reality and fantasy get blurred.</p><p>Like they did last night.</p><p></p><p></p><p>One</p><p>Highway 71 stretched in front of my car, black asphalt scrolling beneath my wheels. Seven hours into my drive back to Austin, I was wondering why I hadn&#x2019;t just flown Southwest.</p><p>Sometimes I like taking a long road trip by myself&#x2014;listening to my music, relishing the freedom of knowing I absolutely, positively can&#x2019;t work on my thesis for a while. I&#x2019;d enjoyed most of this drive back from New Orleans, but now that the sun had gone down and I still had an hour to go, I felt restless.</p><p><i>Maybe if you hadn&#x2019;t left your car charger at home, where it can do you exactly no good&#x2014;</i></p><p>I groaned, thinking of my cell phone in my purse, dead for more than an hour now. Instead of putting on my favorite high-energy playlist for the final leg of my journey, I was at the mercy of the radio. Every station seemed dedicated to putting me to sleep.</p><p>Then again, it was late. After ten P.M. Most people were winding down, taking it easy as they listened to mellower music, maybe snuggling up to someone they loved.</p><p>A sultry Latin number began, soft guitar and thumping drums suggesting sensuality with every beat&#x2014;and reminding me how long I&#x2019;d been alone.</p><p>My last breakup had taken place four months before. Sometimes I missed Geordie, even though I knew splitting had been the right choice. At age thirty, he&#x2019;s still in party-hearty mode, while at twenty-five I already feel more grown-up than he probably ever will. We&#x2019;d always been more friends than red-hot lovers anyway. Our sex life&#x2014;well, I couldn&#x2019;t blame Geordie there. Probably most women would have been more than happy with what he had to offer. I was the one who had longed for something Geordie couldn&#x2019;t provide.</p><p><i>At least you told him what you really wanted. You finally trusted someone else enough to tell, and that alone counts for something, doesn&#x2019;t it? He just couldn&#x2019;t go there with you.</i></p><p>But I&#x2019;d felt so shamed. So exposed. I&#x2019;d confessed my deepest fantasies to Geordie, hoping he&#x2019;d play along, and instead he&#x2019;d freaked out. Oh, he tried to be sympathetic, all &#x201c;But <i>why</i> do you think you feel this way?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what I pay my therapist for. What I needed from him was something a whole lot dirtier. A whole lot scarier. And gentle, funny Geordie couldn&#x2019;t give it to me.</p><p>Maybe I was being the rigid one. I figured I shouldn&#x2019;t condemn a guy for <i>not</i> getting off on the idea of forcing a woman. So I reminded myself, <i>Geordie gets to have limits too&#x2014;</i></p><p>The steering wheel jerked in my hands. I managed to keep my Civic from spinning out, but barely. It wobbled violently, pulling hard to one side as I guided it onto the shoulder. The hum of tires against highway gave way to jagged pops of gravel under my car. Once I&#x2019;d cleared the road, I put the car in park, turned the key, and sat there for a moment, one hand held over my wildly thumping heart.</p><p><i>Shit. I&#x2019;ve blown a tire.</i></p><p>I stepped out of my car, my sandals crunching in the roadside grit, as I inspected the damage. As I&#x2019;d thought, the passenger-side front tire was completely blown out; strips of blackened rubber had peeled away, and it was already completely deflated against the ground.</p><p>Biting my lower lip, I glanced up and down the highway. I hadn&#x2019;t quite made it as far as Giddings, which was the closest thing to a real town in this part of Texas. The next outpost of civilization was probably at least half an hour&#x2019;s walk from here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the dark, without even a streetlamp to guide me. Why hadn&#x2019;t I brought the stupid car charger? I&#x2019;d have given a lot to have my cell phone with me so I could call for help. I could&#x2019;ve bought another one in any gas station along the way; it wasn&#x2019;t like they were expensive. But I hadn&#x2019;t. So I was alone, in the dark, totally on my own.</p><p>Of course, as a modern, independent woman, I&#x2019;d learned how to change a flat tire. I&#x2019;d practiced so I&#x2019;d be able to do it in a crisis. Except that the last time I practiced was eight years earlier, when I was a junior in high school.</p><p>I squared my shoulders. <i>Okay, Vivienne. You can do this. Let&#x2019;s make it happen.</i></p><p>As I took the jack from the trunk, I decided to ditch the little cardigan I wore over my red sundress. In Texas in August, the weather was too warm to work hard while wearing extra layers, even this late at night. Besides, I didn&#x2019;t want to get grease all over my entire outfit if I could help it.</p><p>A truck&#x2019;s headlights appeared on the horizon, heading toward me. I was torn. <i>Wave for help or duck behind the car, so the driver doesn&#x2019;t see that I&#x2019;m a woman out here alone?</i></p><p>My fantasies were one thing. Reality was another. I wanted help really badly, but I walked behind the car.</p><p>Not that it mattered&#x2014;the eighteen-wheeler barreled past me so fast my compact car rocked in its wake. The breeze blew my hair in my face and whipped the skirt of my sundress. Once the truck was well ahead of me, I took off my cardigan and tossed it into the front seat, then got down to business.</p><p>Okay. Obviously the first step was jacking up the car. I knelt beside the flat tire, angled the jack&#x2014;and heard another car driving toward me.</p><p>Slowing down.</p><p>And stopping.</p><p>Headlights bathed me in their brilliance. I held up one hand, unable to see for the glare. Fear prickled along my skin. I took the lug wrench firmly in my fist as I stood, still holding my other hand against the light, and tried to keep my voice steady as I called, &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Looks like you&#x2019;ve got trouble.&#x201d;</p><p>The driver stepped forward, the headlights silhouetting his tall, masculine form. As my eyes adjusted to the brightness, I could finally see his face.</p><p><i>Oh, my God.</i></p><p>All the adrenaline in my bloodstream changed. The fear was still there, sharper as I saw how broad his shoulders were, and the muscles in his arms&#x2014;but now that fear was matched by excitement, raw and primal. This man&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>He was tall, a couple inches over six feet. His jeans were slung beneath his almost impossibly tapered waist, which only exaggerated how muscular his thighs were. His black T-shirt clung to him tightly. Stubble shadowed his angular jaw, and his dark hair was cut almost military-short in a way that emphasized the strong lines of his face. His gray eyes raked over me, as I remembered why I&#x2019;d worn the cardigan to begin with&#x2014;my sundress was low-cut, and his gaze made it clear he&#x2019;d noticed.</p><p>My hand tightened around the wrench.</p><p>&#x201c;What seems to be the problem?&#x201d; He took a step closer.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a flat tire. I&#x2019;ve got a spare.&#x201d; I sounded breathless. Afraid. Would that encourage him to help me, or make it clear just how much power he had over me at this moment?</p><p>One of his eyebrows lifted. Clearly he&#x2019;d picked up on the fact that I was nervous. It seemed to amuse him. &#x201c;Can you change a flat?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; That was possibly not the entire truth, but I figured I could manage if I had to.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have any help on the way? Triple A?&#x201d; His gray eyes met mine again, but it was difficult for me to make out his expression with his headlights shining in my eyes. &#x201c;A boyfriend?&#x201d;</p><p><i>Is he trying to find out if I&#x2019;m single, or trying to find out if anybody would know if something happened to me?</i></p><p>No one would.</p><p>I tried to smile; I probably failed. &#x201c;Yeah. Triple A said they&#x2019;d be here in&#x2014;oh, another fifteen minutes or so.&#x201d; My voice sounded sharp, borderline rude, but I couldn&#x2019;t worry about that. All I could think was, <i>Why did I say that? Fifteen minutes was too long. Fifteen minutes is more than enough time for him to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>His smile was a quick flash in the darkness, as hard-edged as a straight razor. &#x201c;I can change that flat in five. That is&#x2014;if you&#x2019;re not too proud to ask for help.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Proud?&#x201d; This guy had pulled over next to me in the dead of night, started interrogating me, and wanted to lecture me on my attitude? Fuck being afraid; I got mad. &#x201c;Listen, if you think it&#x2019;s <i>funny</i> that I&#x2019;d be worried about a stranger in this situation, I&#x2019;m afraid you don&#x2019;t understand some very basic, sad facts of life.&#x201d;</p><p>He drew back, his gray eyes narrowing, almost like I&#x2019;d slapped him. Had he taken my fear as an insult? Maybe it was one; I&#x2019;d as good as said I thought he couldn&#x2019;t be trusted. However, when he spoke again, his deep voice was gentler. Meant to soothe. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t thinking. Here. Let me take care of this for you and get you on your way.&#x201d;</p><p>He held out his hand for the wrench. Obviously he&#x2019;d need it to change my flat. But it was also the only potential weapon I had.</p><p><i>Do I trust this guy?</i></p><p>I took one step closer to him, squinting to see. Now his body blocked the headlights a little more, and I could examine his face more carefully. Strong brow. Firm, straight nose like a slash through his perfectly symmetrical face. A surprisingly full lower lip. He looked powerfully, almost aggressively masculine. Like someone who took what he wanted. And yet his eyes never glanced away from mine, as though he had nothing to hide&#x2014;</p><p>Even though I wanted to trust those eyes, I couldn&#x2019;t. This man was a total stranger. What it boiled down to was this: If he was a good guy, then I could rely on him. If he was a bad guy, he could probably get the lug wrench away from me any time he wanted.</p><p>I hesitated one instant longer, then handed him the wrench.</p><p>He took it and stepped past me to get to work.</p><p>During the next few minutes, while he worked in silence except for the clanking of metal, I stood awkwardly in front of his dark sedan. Even now I found it difficult to relax around this guy. What if he was just toying with me? Trying to get me off my guard?</p><p><i>Oh, come on</i>, I told myself. <i>Like any rapist on earth would go to the trouble of changing a flat tire first.</i></p><p>But those fears weren&#x2019;t the main reason I found it hard to relax. What got to me was that I found my rescuer sexy as hell. And he&#x2019;d been sexy to me even when I&#x2019;d been scared of him.</p><p><i>Just what did you think he was going to do to you?</i></p><p><i>What did you</i> want <i>him to do to you?</i></p><p>As I watched him&#x2014;his strong arms wrestling with the wheel, the headlights shining on the muscular expanse of his back or his stern profile&#x2014;my mind filled with visions I didn&#x2019;t want to want. Visions of him bending me over the back of my car, pushing up the skirt of my sundress. Of him pulling me into the backseat, putting my hand on his cock, whispering, <i>Time to thank me.</i> His hands fisting in my hair as he towed me down on my knees&#x2014;</p><p><i>Stop it.</i></p><p>I shook my head, pushing the loose strands of my hair back from my face. My cheeks felt hot. My pulse still raced, thumping in my chest, throbbing between my legs. I was turned on and confused and angry with myself. I wanted him to finish changing my flat so I could get back into my car and drive the rest of the way home, pretending I&#x2019;d never had a bigger problem than crappy music on the radio.</p><p>Then I could also pretend he hadn&#x2019;t made me feel so hungry. So ashamed.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said. A few clicks of the jack, and my car settled back onto the ground. When he stood up, he had a smudge of dark grease along one cheekbone. &#x201c;That should get you home. But it&#x2019;s just a spare. You need to buy a new tire right away instead of driving around on this one for too long.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know that,&#x201d; I retorted, stung.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; His smile was knowing, almost disdainful. &#x201c;I forgot I was talking to an expert.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Okay, so he&#x2019;s a smug son of a bitch, but he&#x2019;s the son of a bitch who just saved your ass.</i> I swallowed my irritation. &#x201c;Listen&#x2014;thanks. Seriously. I don&#x2019;t know what I would&#x2019;ve done without you. I owe you one.&#x201d;</p><p>His smile faded. &#x201c;Then do me a favor. Don&#x2019;t try to be superwoman next time. Join Triple A, stay in the car and keep it locked, whatever you have to do to keep yourself safe.&#x201d; He handed me back the wrench. &#x201c;You should be more careful who you trust.&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes searched mine again, and I hoped my face was in shadow&#x2014;enough that he couldn&#x2019;t see how flushed I was. Then he turned and walked back to his sedan.</p><p>As his door slammed, I went to the driver&#x2019;s side of my Civic, legs trembling beneath me. I got back in and hit the locks. His car pulled back onto the highway,...</p></p><h2>The Mitten Book : Delightful Swedish Country Mitten Patterns with Traditional Designs to Use for All Your Hand or Machine Knitting Projects</h2><p>From the storm-tossed island of Gotland off the coast of Sweden come these patterns for beautiful, traditional mittens.

Their works at first shocked a conservative public; but their successive exhibitions, their magazine &#34;Ver Sacrum&#34;, and their application to the applied arts and architecture soon brought them an enthusiastic following and wealthy patronage. This book traces the course of this development, of the Wiener Werkstatte that followed, and the individual works of the artists concerned. Klimt, Olbrich, Loos and Hoffmann in architecture and applied arts. In other fields Mahler, Freud and Schnitzler were influencing the avant-garde. Peter Vergo quotes extensively from the writings of contemporary reviewers, critics and the artists themselves. He has eye-witness accounts of the exhibitions, the opening of the Secession building, the work in progress on the Palais Stoclet and Kabarett Fledermaus. The result is a documentary study of the successes and failures, hopes and fears of the members of an artistic movement which is still admired today.</p><p></p><h2>The Most Beautiful Villages of Scotland</h2><p><p><strong>An unprecedented treasure trove of delightful villages from the land of mist and mystery, of hidden glens and peaceful lochs.</strong></p> In the dramatic landscapes of Scotland, beloved of Romantic poets and composers, lies a wealth of delightful villages, here revealed in Hugh Palmer's evocative photographs and commentaries.<br><br> The traditional architecture and stunning natural settings of the Highland villages have long proved an attraction to visitors.

Lowland villages often have an air of quiet, well-ordered prosperity. Rows of stone cottages and a fantastic profusion of hanging baskets make places like Luss on Loch Lomond a charming stop on the road north. Here, too, is the extraordinary Dean Village&#x2015;a complete, self-contained community surrounded by the city of Edinburgh. And among the many ravishing port-villages on the Islands is the little gem of Tobermory on Mull, where the reflection of a main street of brightly painted houses shimmers in the waters of the harbor.<br><br> Altogether, thirty-five villages are included.

S. Newman during a hurricane in the 1890s. 25,000 first printing.</p><p><i>Fire on the Beach</i> is a wonderful book on a forgotten piece of history: The story of an all-black unit of the U.S. Life-Saving Service on North Carolina's "beautiful and unforgiving" Outer Banks. Stationed on Pea Island, near the hazardous "Graveyard of the Atlantic," the men of the segregated Station 17 showed that African Americans were just as capable as their white peers when it came to saving the lives of sailors and passengers whose ships foundered on deadly shoals. Their leader was Richard Etheridge, an inspiring figure born into slavery. He fought during the Civil War and later entered the LSS. Much of the book is a reconstruction of his life, and Civil War buffs will appreciate the extensive treatment given to his military service. <p> Yet <i>Fire on the Beach</i> is not a mere biography. It's a fascinating portrait of 19th-century Outer Banks culture, long before these isolated little towns became tourist destinations. Authors David Wright and David Zoby, for instance, describe "wreckers" whose main occupation--a surprisingly profitable one--was combing the beach for the detritus of shipwrecks. The town of Nags Head apparently derives its odd name from this weird heritage: "Many claim that the name Nags Head originated in an era when malicious wreckers would tie a lantern around an old horse's neck and lead it up and down the dunes. From the sea, the rising and falling light would give the impression of a ship safely moored in a harbor, taunting unsuspecting ship captains to sail to their destructions." Even without these manmade deceptions, the seas off the coast of North Carolina were plenty treacherous, giving Etheridge and his men lots of rescue work. Race is a necessary and fundamental theme of the book, and Etheridge knew he would have to defy white skeptics by proving his abilities over and over: "There was no room for error. The continuation of the black station could be compromised by any slipup, no matter how slight. Misjudgment or poor performance could result in his or one of his crewmen's dismissal. Inadequacies, no matter how slight, could lead to the reinstatement of a white keeper and crew. They had to excel if they were to maintain their station." <i>Fire on the Beach</i> ultimately rises above the parochialism of race: It is a gripping story about "a man among the men" and his harrowing exploits. When Wright and Zoby describe Etheridge's role in saving the crew of the schooner <i>E.S. Newman</i> in hurricane conditions, the skin color of Etheridge and his men does not matter at all. Fans of <i>The Perfect Storm</i> and <i>Isaac's Storm</i>--books that mix thrilling sea stories with calamitous weather--are sure to enjoy <i>Fire on the Beach</i>. <i>--John Miller</i></p><b>David Wright</b> is an assistant professor of English and African-American Studies at the University of Illinois.

So said Albert Einstein in response to the first discoveries that launched quantum physics, as they suggested a random universe that seemed to violate the laws of common sense. This 20th-century scientific revolution completely shattered Newtonian laws, inciting a crisis of thought that challenged scientists to think differently about matter and subatomic particles.<i>The Dreams That Stuff Is Made Of</i> compiles the essential works from the scientists who sparked the paradigm shift that changed the face of physics forever, pushing our understanding of the universe on to an entirely new level of comprehension. Gathered in this anthology is the scholarship that shocked and befuddled the scientific world, including works by Niels Bohr, Max Planck, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Erwin Schrodinger, J.

R. Covey, widely known as one of the world&#x2019;s leading authorities on trust, asserts that it is &#x201c;the most overlooked, misunderstood, underutilized asset to enable performance. Its impact, for good or bad, is dramatic and pervasive. It&#x2019;s something you can&#x2019;t escape.&#x201d; Thankfully, it&#x2019;s is also the thing that can dramatically improve your personal and professional success.<br> <br>Why trust?

It specifically demonstrates how to establish trust intentionally so that you and your organization can forego the time-killing, bureaucratic check-and-balance processes that is so often deployed in lieu of actual trust.<br> <br>This 2018 updated edition includes an insightful afterword by the author which explores ten key reasons why trust is more relevant now than ever before&#x2014;including how trust is the new currency of our world today.</p><p>Stephen M.

We had just come out of a very exhausting meeting, during which it had become evident that there were serious internal trust issues. These issues were slowing things down and negatively affecting execution. The senior leader said to me privately, "These meetings are dysfunctional and a waste of time. I just don't trust 'Mike.' I don't trust 'Ellen.'

Either you have trust or you don't. We don't have it, and there's nothing we can do about it."</p><p>I strongly disagree. In fact, both my personal life and my work as a business practitioner over the past 20 years have convinced me that there is a <i>lot</i> we can do about it. We <i>can</i> increase trust -- much faster than we might think -- and doing so will have a huge impact, both in the quality of our lives and in the results we're able to achieve.</p><p></p><p><b>TRUST ISSUES AFFECT EVERYONE</b></p><p>As I speak to audiences around the world about the Speed of Trust, I repeatedly hear expressions of frustration and discouragement such as these:</p><blockquote><p><i>I can't stand the politics at work. I feel sabotaged by my peers. It seems like everyone is out for himself and will do anything to get ahead.</i></p><p><i>I've really been burned in the past. How can I ever trust anyone enough to have a real relationship?</i></p><p><i>I work in an organization that's bogged down with bureaucracy. It takes forever to get anything done. I have to get authorization to buy a pencil!</i></p><p><i>The older my children get, the less they listen to me. What can I do?</i></p><p><i>I feel like my contributions at work are hardly ever recognized or valued.</i></p><p><i>I foolishly violated the trust of someone who was supremely important to me. If I could hit "rewind" and make the decision differently, I would do it in a heartbeat. But I can't. Will I ever be able to rebuild the relationship?</i></p><p><i>I have to walk on eggshells at work. If I say what I really think, I'll get fired . . . or at least made irrelevant.</i></p><p><i>My boss micromanages me and everyone else at work. He treats us all like we can't be trusted. </i></p><p><i>With all the scandals, corruption, and ethical violations in our society today, I feel like someone has pulled the rug out from under me. I don't know what -- or who -- to trust anymore.</i></p></blockquote><p>So what do you do if you're in a situation like one of these -- or in any situation where a lack of trust creates politics and bureaucracy, or simply slows things down? Do you merely accept this as the cost of doing business? Or can you do something to counteract or even reverse it?</p><p>I affirm that you <i>can</i> do something about it. In fact, by learning how to establish, grow, extend, and restore trust, you can positively and significantly alter the trajectory of this and every future moment of your life.</p><p></p><p><b>GETTING A HANDLE ON TRUST</b></p><p>So what is trust? Rather than giving a complex definition, I prefer to use the words of Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric. He said, "[Y]ou know it when you feel it."</p><p>Simply put, trust means <i>confidence</i>. The opposite of trust -- distrust -- is <i>suspicion</i>. When you trust people, you have confidence in them -- in their integrity and in their abilities. When you distrust people, you are suspicious of them -- of their integrity, their agenda, their capabilities, or their track record. It's that simple. We have all had experiences that validate the difference between relationships that are built on trust and those that are not. These experiences clearly tell us the difference is not small; it is dramatic.</p><p>Take a minute right now and think of a person with whom you have a high trust relationship -- perhaps a boss, coworker, customer, spouse, parent, sibling, child, or friend. Describe this relationship. What's it like? How does it feel? How well do you communicate? How quickly can you get things done? How much do you enjoy this relationship?</p><p>Now think of a person with whom you have a low-trust relationship. Again, this person could be anyone at work or at home. Describe this relationship. What's it like? How does it feel? How is the communication? Does it flow quickly and freely . . . or do you feel like you're constantly walking on land mines and being misunderstood? Do you work together to get things done quickly . . . or does it take a disproportionate amount of time and energy to finally reach agreement and execution? Do you enjoy this relationship . . . or do you find it tedious, cumbersome, and draining?</p><p>The difference between a high- and low-trust relationship is palpable! Take communication. In a high-trust relationship, you can say the wrong thing, and people will still get your meaning. In a low-trust relationship, you can be very measured, even precise, and they'll still misinterpret you.</p><p>Can you even begin to imagine the difference it would make if you were able to increase the amount of trust in the important personal and professional relationships in your life?</p><p></p><p><b>THE CRUCIBLE</b></p><p>One of the most formative experiences I've had personally in increasing trust occurred several years ago as a result of the merger between Franklin Quest and Covey Leadership Center to form FranklinCovey Company. As anyone who has ever been through a merger or an acquisition will know, these things are never easy. The merged company had terrific strengths. We had great people, superb content, loyal clients, and productive tools. But the blending of the two cultures was proving to be enormously challenging.</p><p>As president of the Training and Education business unit, I had traveled to Washington, D.C., to address about a third of our consultants on the topic of our division's strategy. But a meeting that should have had me looking forward with anticipation literally had my stomach churning.</p><p>Several weeks before, the company's new CEO -- frustrated (as we all were) with the enormous problems and friction that had beset what had seemed to be a promising merger -- had scheduled a meeting of all the consultants in the company. In an effort to "get out" everyone's concerns, he had created a format in which we, as leaders, were to listen, but could not respond, to anything anyone wanted to say. The meeting, scheduled to last four hours, turned into a 10-hour "dump" session. With no one allowed to amend, correct, give context, supply missing information, discuss the other side of the issues, or even show the dilemmas involved, only a small percentage of what was said had real contextual accuracy. Most was misinterpreted, manipulated, or twisted, and some of it was flat-out wrong. There were assumptions, suspicions, accusations, frustrations. And, as leaders, we had reluctantly agreed to a format in which we weren't permitted to say a word.</p><p>In the end, we'd had over a dozen such meetings. The whole experience had been brutal, and, with my position of leadership, I had taken it all personally. Having had some experience on Wall Street, I knew mergers were usually hard, but I had thought we could do what needed to be done to make this one work.</p><p>The problem was that I had assumed far too much. Mistakenly, I had failed to focus on establishing trust with the newly merged company, believing that my reputation and credibility would already be known. But they weren't, and, as a result, half the people trusted me and the other half didn't. And it was pretty much divided right down Covey or Franklin "party" lines. Those from the Covey side who knew me and had worked with me basically saw my decisions as a sincere effort to use objective, external criteria in every decision and to do what was best for the business -- not to try to push a "Covey" agenda . . . in fact, sometimes even bending over backward to avoid it. Those who didn't know me, hadn't worked with me, and didn't trust me interpreted every decision in the exact opposite manner.</p><p>In one case, for example, a question had come up concerning the use of the Sundance Resort for one of our leadership development programs. Sundance had been somewhat hard to work with, and some felt we should move the program to another venue. The program director strongly wanted to keep it at Sundance because clients loved the location, and the financial data showed that we were averaging nearly 40 percent more revenue per program held there compared to other venues. I said, "Because the economics are better and the program director strongly recommends that we keep it there, we'll find better ways to work with Sundance." That was an example of a solid business decision I assumed people would understand.</p><p>But those who didn't trust me didn't understand. They thought I was trying to push a "Covey" approach. Some even wondered if I was getting some kind of kickback because, as a community leader, I had been asked to serve in an unpaid role on the advisory board for the Sundance Children's Theater. Many suspected my motive. Because there was such low trust, the feeling was, "There's got to be some kind of hidden agenda going on here." </p><p>In another situation, I had made the decision to move "Ron," an extremely talented leader who had come from the Covey side into a different position because, like many of us, he had gotten caught in merger politics and had polarized the two camps. I had decided to go outside the organization for Ron's replacement so that there would be no perception that the new manager was a "Covey" person or a "Franklin" person.</p><p>When I made this announcement, I thought people would be excited by my attempt to bring in new talent. But among those who didn't trust me, no one even heard the part about bringing ...</p></p><h2>Uncensored Sales Strategies: A Radical New Approach to Selling Your Customers What They Really Want - No Matter What Business You&#39;re In</h2><p><p><b>Sex Sells...</b> </p><p>With a gift for sales, Sydney Biddle Barrows, once known infamously as the Mayflower Madam, found wealth in selling her customers exactly what they wanted - and shockingly, it wasn't sex!

Through her own experiences, she takes you where no other sales expert has ever taken you and equips you to fine-tune your own sales process providing the ultimate payoff! </p><p><b>[REVIEW:]</b> </p><p>The fast-talking, closing-obsessed salesperson of the past is dead and doesn&#x2019;t know it. Potential customers hate being bullied; though they may cave in the face of such old-style aggression, they won&#x2019;t be back and they won&#x2019;t send referrals. Barrows and Kennedy make an irrefutable case that people are more beguiled by an approach centered on providing an experience consistent with inner desires than a pressure-sell. </p><p>Barrows urges listening first, then selling clients what they yearn for. &#x201c;What problem are they trying to solve, what pain are they seeking to alleviate or avoid? What pleasure or gain are they hoping to experience? What do they see as the ideal outcome and how will that make them feel?&#x201d; This approach meets less sales resistance than trying to convince people to want what is already on hand. </p><p>The author and co-author are an absolutely unique duo in the sphere of marketing. Sydney Biddle Barrows first came to the public&#x2019;s notice when labeled by the press as the &#x201c;Mayflower Madam,&#x201d;&#x2014;mistress of a highly lucrative out-call service, called Cachet. She is now a highly in demand public speaker, business mentor, and management consultant. Dan Kennedy is a consulting guru whose daily fee (which folks line up to pay) is about the same as the average annual per capita income in the U.S. His eleven previous books include The No B.S. series of specialized sales guides. </p><p>According to Barrows and Kennedy, the smart seller should shift focus from products and pricing, to the minds of customers, and put their energy into building honest relationships. Those who aren&#x2019;t sure exactly what business they&#x2019;re really in (answer: whatever legal business the clients want you to be in) will soon be out of business. Niche businesses are lucrative, but sub-niches serving a very particularized segment are even more suc-cessful because the seller can tailor their approach to more closely match expectations. One proviso: the techniques detailed here apply without modifica-tion only to those serving clients with plenty of disposable cash. Individuals on limited budgets might like to be catered to, but they still check the price tag. </p><p>Several additional sales specialists contribute short sections that reinforce Barrows&#x2019; and Kennedy&#x2019;s priorities through examples of their own successes and learning experiences. The general approach is concerned with ending overt coercion in the sales process; it&#x2019;s about deeply understanding the movies playing in clients&#x2019; heads. That&#x2019;s the direction of the future for the entire occupation. Don&#x2019;t discount the advice of the madam and the madman; they might know more about your business than you do. <br>(January) Review by: Todd Mercer, Foreword magazine, January/February 2009</p></p><p><p><b>Sydney Biddle Barrows,</b> known today for her innovative, unorthodox, approach to sales, is perhaps best known for her reign as the Mayflower Madam when she founded and operated New York's most elite, premium-priced escort service.

But at the turn of the century, the money to be made was in oil, citrus, water rights, and the railroads. Mack would have it all, if he had his way. And along the way, the men and women he met, the passion he found, the enemies he made, and the great historical figures like William Randolph Hearts, Leland Stanford, and Theodore Roosevelt, he encountered, helped bring glory to the extraordinary century.<br>"Riveting...CALIFORNIA GOLD strikes pay dirt....This sweeping epic is a dynamite tribute to the sheer pluck of one man who scorns all obstacles. He instills vibrancy in all his characterizations."<br>RICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH<br>A Literary Guild Main Selection<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p><b>John Jakes </b>is the bestselling author of Charleston, the Kent Family Chronicles, the North and South trilogy, <i>On Secret Service</i>, <i>California Gold, Homeland</i>, and <i>American Dreams</i>. Descended from a soldier of the Virginia Continental Line who fought in the American Revolution, Jakes is one of today&#x2019;s most distinguished authors of historical fiction.California, supposedly "the world's paradigm of hope and opportunity," is Jakes's ( North and South ) setting for this moderately satisfying novel about Mack Chance, an underdog whose ascent from poverty to affluence is a classic American success story. Like so many ambitious dreamers, Mack, an indigent Pennsylvanian, arrives in San Francisco in 1887 determined to make his fortune. To his dismay, he finds hardship, violence, bigotry, lawlessness and a city caught in the stranglehold of rapacious Southern Pacific railroad tycoons. Mack meets two bewitching women--rich, emotionally unstable Carla Hellman and dynamic Nellie Ross, a reporter for W. R. Hearst's San Francisco Examiner. After striking oil and becoming an orange grower, Mack prospers, but is left heartbroken when career-oriented Nellie won't marry him. He impulsively weds Carla, with disastrous results, while alienating many influential men by championing liberal causes. With strong commercial appeal, the novel potently conveys the raw, irrepressible vitality of California, but the historical backdrop (especially the 1906 earthquake) outshines the conventional rags-to-riches plot. Jakes's impressive research, plus his lively depictions of Hearst, Ambrose Bierce, Leland Stanford, Teddy Roosevelt and others, enriches the story considerably.

Mint condition. As new. Unmarked. Uncreased. Well maintained from a private collection.</p><p>Despite the federal budget crisis and thanks to private monies, the Vermeer exhibition at the National Gallery is underway. To coincide with the exhibition, curator Wheelock has put together a thoroughly researched catalog of the exhibition's 23 works. Through the bits of evidence gleaned from Vermeer's life and 17th-century historical fact, Wheelock has pieced together Vermeer's artistic and geographical influences. The essay on the artist's use of perspective is the most remarkable because it enables the reader to understand the technician behind the artist; X-radiographs, included throughout the book, detail how Vermeer used a pin and a string to exercise his near-perfect perspective in his paintings. The excellent, full-size color plates are accompanied by brief descriptions of provenance, exhibitions, and technique. Although some claims made about the artist lack written documentation, this carefully researched work is recommended for fine arts collections. Given the popularity of the exhibition, large public libraries will also want to purchase.<br><i>Julie C.

He lives with his family in England.chapter 1<br><br>Earth Calling<br><br>Drifting through interstellar space, three light-�years out from the star 31 Aquilae, the Ne�na abode cluster picked up a series of short, faint electromagnetic pulses that lasted intermittently for eighteen years. The early signatures were familiar to the Ne�na, and faintly worrying: nuclear fission detonations, followed seven years later by fusion explosions. The technological progress of whoever was detonating them was exceptionally swift by the usual metric of emerging civilizations.<br><br>Metaviral spawn chewed into the cometry chunks that anchored the vast cluster, spinning out a string of flimsy receiver webs twenty kilometers across. They aligned themselves on the G-�class star fifty light-�years away, where the savage weapons were being deployed.<br><br>Sure enough, a torrent of weak electromagnetic signals was pouring out from the star&#x2019;s third planet. A sentient species was entering into its early scientific industrial state.<br><br>The Ne�na were concerned that so many nuclear weapons were being used. Clearly, the new species was disturbingly aggressive. Some of the cluster&#x2019;s minds welcomed that.<br><br>Analysis of the radio signals, now becoming analogue audiovisual broadcasts, revealed a bipedal race organized along geo-�tribal lines, and constantly in conflict. Their specific biochemical composition was one that, from the Ne�na perspective, gave them sadly short lives. That was posited as the probable reason behind their faster than usual technological progression.<br><br>That there would be an expedition was never in doubt; the Ne�na saw that as their duty no matter what kind of life evolved on distant worlds. The only question now concerned the level of assistance to be offered. Those who welcomed the new species&#x2019; aggressive qualities wanted to make the full spectrum of Ne�na technology available. They almost prevailed.<br><br>The spherical insertion ship that left the cluster&#x2014;�it didn&#x2019;t know if it was one of many being dispatched, or alone&#x2014;�measured a hundred meters in diameter, a mass comprised of active molecule blocks. It spent three months accelerating up to thirty percent of light speed along a course to Altair&#x2014;�a trip that took just over a hundred years. During the lonely voyage the ship&#x2019;s controlling sentience continued to monitor the electromagnetic signals coming from the young civilization that was its ultimate goal. It built up an impressive knowledge base of human biology, as well as a comprehensive understanding of their constantly evolving tribal political and economic structures.<br><br>When the ship reached Altair, it performed a complex flyby maneuver, which aligned it perfectly on Sol. After that, the physical section of the sentience&#x2019;s memory that contained all the astrogation data of the flight from the cluster to Altair was jettisoned and the constituent blocks deactivated. Its weakened atomic structure broke apart into an expanding cloud of dust, which was quickly dispersed by Altair&#x2019;s solar wind. Now, if it was ever intercepted, the insertion ship could never betray the position of the Ne�na abode cluster&#x2014;�for it no longer knew where it was.<br><br>The last fifty years of the voyage were spent formatting an emplacement strategy. By now, human ingenuity had produced starships that were flying past the insertion ship in the other direction, in quest of new worlds out among the stars. The information blasting out from Earth and the solar system&#x2019;s asteroid habitats had become increasingly sophisticated, yet, conversely, there was a lot less of it. Radio signals had been in decline since the internet had begun to carry the bulk of human data traffic. For the final twenty years of the insertion ship&#x2019;s approach it received little apart from entertainment broadcasts, and even those were shrinking year by year. But it had enough.<br><br>It flew in south of the ecliptic, shedding cold mass in irregular bursts like a black comet&#x2014;�a deceleration maneuver that took three years. This was always the riskiest part of the voyage. The humans&#x2019; solar system was scattered with a great many astronomical sensors scanning the universe for cosmological abnormalities. By the time it passed the Kuiper belt, the insertion ship was down to twenty-�five meters in diameter. It emitted no magnetic or gravitational fields. The outer shell was fully radiation absorbent, so there was no albedo, making it invisible to any telescopes. Thermal emission was zero.<br><br>No one perceived its arrival.<br><br>Inside, four biologics began to grow within molecular initiators, attaining physical patterns the ship&#x2019;s sentience had designed, based on the information it had acquired during the long voyage.<br><br>They were human in size and shape; skeletons and organs carried the mimicry down to a biochemical level. Their DNA was equally authentic. You would have to go a lot deeper into the cells to find any abnormality; only a detailed audit of the organelles would reveal alien molecular structures.<br><br>It was the minds of the biologics that gave the insertion ship the greatest difficulty. Human mental processes were complex verging on paradoxical. Worse, it suspected the performances in all the fictional dramas it received were overemphasizing emotional responses. So it constructed a stable primary architecture of thought routines, while including a fast learning and adaptive integration procedure.<br><br>As it closed to within a million kilometers of Earth, the insertion ship discarded the last of its reaction mass as it performed a final deceleration maneuver. Now it was basically just falling toward the southernmost tip of South America. Tiny course correction ejecta refined the descent vector, steering it at Tierra del Fuego, which was still thirty minutes from greeting the dawn. Even if it was detected now, it would simply appear to be a small chunk of natural space debris.<br><br>It hit the upper atmosphere and began to peel apart into four pear-�shaped segments. The remaining matter broke away in fizzing sparks that produced a short-�lived but beautiful starburst display streaking through the mesosphere. Below it, sheltered under their blanket of thick winter cloud, the residents of Ushuaia, the southernmost city on Earth, remained oblivious of their interstellar visitor.<br><br>Each segment carried on down, aerobraking with increasing severity as the atmosphere thickened around them. They slowed to subsonic velocity three kilometers above the surface, plunging through the clouds, still unobserved by anyone on the planet.<br><br>The segments were aimed at a small inlet a few kilometers west of the city, where, even in AD 2162, the rugged land lay unclaimed by developers. Two hundred meters from the shore, four tall splash plumes shot up into the air like thick geysers, crowning and splattering down on the slushy ice that bobbed along the waters of the Beagle Channel.<br><br>The Ne�na metahumans floated to the surface. All that now remained of the insertion ship landing segments was a thick layer of active molecule blocks covering their skin like a pelt of translucent gel, insulating them from the dangerously cold water. They began to swim ashore.<br><br>The beach was a narrow strip of gray stones cluttered with dead branches. A dense woodland occupied the slope above it. The aliens scrambled a short way up the incline as the pale dawn light began to seep through the murky clouds. Their protective layer liquidized, draining down into the stones where it would be flushed away by the next high tide. For the first time, they drew air down into their lungs.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, that is cold!&#x201d; one exclaimed.<br><br>&#x201c;Good classification,&#x201d; another agreed through chattering teeth. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go with it.&#x201d;<br><br>They looked at one another in the gray light. Two were crying from the emotional impact of arrival, one was smiling in wonder, while the fourth appeared singularly unimpressed by the bleak landscape. Each carried a small pack of outdoor clothing copied from a winter wear ad broadcast eighteen months earlier. They hurried to put it on.<br><br>When they were fully dressed, they set off along an ancient track up through the trees until they came to the remnants of National Route Three, which led to Ushuaia.<br><br>The Assessment Team<br><br>Feriton Kayne, New York, June 23, 2204<br><br>I was never really that impressed with New York.

Right there on my desk the name plate says: Feriton Kayne, Deputy Director, Connexion Exosolar Security Division. And if you can work out what I actually do from that, you&#x2019;re smarter than most.<br><br>My office was on the seventy-�seventh floor of the Connexion Corp tower. Ainsley Zangari wanted his global headquarters in Manhattan, and did he ever want everyone to know about it. There are few other people alive who could get a site on West 59th Street just along from Columbus Circle. He had to keep the fa�ade of the old hotel as the base of his 120-�story glass-�and-�carbon monstrosity&#x2014;�why I don&#x2019;t know; it had no architectural value as far as I can make out, but City Hall listed it as a landmark structure. So there you have it. Not even Ainsley Zangari, the richest man there&#x2019;s ever been, can argue City Hall out of heritage.<br><br>I&#x2019;m not complaining. My office gives me the greatest conceivable view out over the city and Central Park&#x2014;�one that the mere super-�rich along Park Avenue can&#x2019;t afford. I&#x2019;ve actually had to position my desk so I work with my back to the floor-�to-�ceiling window. I&#x2019;d be too distracted otherwise. Mind, it is a swivel chair.<br><br>That cloudless June afternoon I was standing looking out at the view, mesmerized as always; the vista resembled one of those seventeenth-�century oil paintings where everything glows with heavenly radiance.<br><br>Kandara Martinez was shown in by a receptionist. The corporate mercenary wore a plain black singlet under a jacket from some midrange fashion house. The way she carried herself made it look like a military uniform. That part of her life just never left her, I guess.<br><br>Sandjay, my altme, splashed the data at me, which the tarsus lenses I wore over my eyeballs presented as a grid of green-�and-�purple text. The file didn&#x2019;t tell me much I didn&#x2019;t already know. She had enrolled in Mexico City&#x2019;s Heroico Colegio Militar when she was nineteen. After graduation she saw several active deployments in the Urban Rapid Suppression Force. Then her parents were killed by a drone bomb some bunch of anti-�imperialist anarchist whack-�jobs launched at the sneering symbol of their evil foreign economic �oppressors&#x2014;�or, in English, the Italian remote drone systems factory where her father worked. After that her escalating kill rate in action started to &#x201c;concern&#x201d; her superiors. She received an honorable discharge in 2187. Freelance corporate security ever since&#x2014;�the real dark jobs.<br><br>In the flesh she was 170 centimeters tall, with chestnut hair, cut short, and gray eyes. I wasn&#x2019;t sure if they were real or gened-�up; they didn&#x2019;t quite seem to belong with the rest of her Mexican ancestry. There&#x2019;d certainly been some bodywork. She kept herself trim&#x2014;�in her line of work that was survival 101&#x2014;�but that couldn&#x2019;t account for the thickness of her limbs; her legs and arms were heavily muscled. Gened-�up or Kcells; the file didn&#x2019;t say. Ms. Martinez left a very small dataprint on solnet.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you for accepting the contract,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a lot happier knowing you&#x2019;re coming with us.&#x201d; Which was only partially true. Her presence made me uncomfortable, but then I know whom she&#x2019;s eliminated during her career.<br><br>&#x201c;I was curious,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;because we all know Connexion has so few people in its own security division.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, about that. We might need something that goes beyond our guys&#x2019; pay grade.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sounds interesting, Feriton.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My boss wants protection, serious protection. We&#x2019;re dealing with the unknown here. This expedition . . . it&#x2019;s different. The artifact we&#x2019;ve found is alien.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So you said. Is it Olyix?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how it could be.&#x201d;<br><br>A small smile lifted her lips. &#x201c;Not going to hide from you, I&#x2019;m very interested. And flattered. Why me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Reputation,&#x201d; I lied. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the best.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bullshit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Seriously. We have to keep this small; the three other people coming with us represent some serious political interests. So I wanted someone with a genuine track record.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re worried that rivals will find out about where we&#x2019;re headed? What sort of artifact have you found?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t tell you that until we&#x2019;re en route.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you retro engineering its tech? Is that why you&#x2019;re worried about rivals?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t about new technology and market impact. We have a bigger problem than that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh?&#x201d; She lifted her eyebrow in query.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get a full briefing when we&#x2019;re underway. Everybody does.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, that&#x2019;s a reasonable containment strategy. But I do need to know: Is it hostile?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Or at least, not yet. Which is where you come in. We need to pack a large punch in a small place. Just in case.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Even more flattered.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One last thing, which is why you and I are having this meeting before I introduce you to the rest of the team.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This doesn&#x2019;t sound good.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There are some first-�contact protocols involved, severe ones. Alpha Defense insisted. We&#x2019;re going to be very isolated for the duration of this mission&#x2014;�something none of us are familiar with. Today, no matter what disaster hits you, everybody can shout for help wherever they are. Everyone functions under the assumption an emergency team is two minutes away. It&#x2019;s all we know. I consider that to be a weakness, especially in this situation. If things go wrong&#x2014;�badly wrong&#x2014;�that&#x2019;s when the Alpha Defense first-�contact protocol applies.&#x201d;<br><br>She caught on fast. I could see the slight change in body posture, humor retreating, muscles tightening.<br><br>&#x201c;If they&#x2019;re hostile, they can&#x2019;t know about us,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;No prisoners. No data downloads.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Her humor swept back in. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re worried about an alien invasion? That&#x2019;s very quaint. What does Ainsley Zangari think they&#x2019;re going to plunder, our gold and our women?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know what they are, so until we do . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Olyix turned out okay. And they had a shitload of antimatter on board the Salvation of Life. There isn&#x2019;t another conventional power source powerful enough to accelerate a vessel that size up to a decent fraction of light speed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We were fortunate with them,&#x201d; I said carefully. &#x201c;Their religion gives them a whole different set of priorities to us. All they want to do is travel across space in their arkship to the end of time, where they believe their God will be waiting for them. They don&#x2019;t want to expand into new star systems and bioform planets to live on; it&#x2019;s a whole different imperative to ours. I guess we didn&#x2019;t really understand what alien meant until they arrived in the Sol system. But, Kandara, do you really want to gamble our species&#x2019; survival on every race being as benign as the Olyix? It&#x2019;s been sixty years since they arrived, and we&#x2019;ve both benefited from trade.

He sees this process as a microcosm of the ways in which the public debate of issues generates more heat than light. The textbooks under consideration, written by a well-known multiculturalist and former leftist activist, were attacked as racist; the charges, made by people who were former activists themselves, were accompanied by a level of acrimony and rage out of all proportion to the subject at hand. Meanwhile, Gitlin notes, the larger issue, the fact that state funding of education has been repeatedly slashed, goes undebated. Widening his discussion, Gitlin goes on to talk about the decline of the Left, whose preoccupation with the needs of select "identities" and "cultures" has caused the movement to squander its energy on petty turf wars. He also argues that the Right, formerly associated with privileged interests, now claims to speak for the common good and has parlayed this image into considerable political clout. Gitlin calls for a return to consensus building in this lucid, eloquent, and persuasive book, which seeks to move us out of the current climate of bitterness and hypersensitivity and toward a more reasoned debate of our most pressing social problems. <i>Joanne Wilkinson</i>"Sophisticated . . . eloquent . . . strong stuff, badly in need of saying."-The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"An important book . . . a plea for bridge building, for acknowledging differences and then doing the harder work of seeing beyond them."-Newsweek<br></p><h2>Star Trek: Vanguard #2: Summon the Thunder</h2><p>The Taurus Reach: a remote interstellar expanse that holds a very old and potentially cataclysmic secret, the truth of which is feared by the Tholians, coveted by the Klingons, and dubiously guarded by the Federation.

You look all slumped over!" </p><p> Ensign Stephen Klisiewicz raised his head from his console at the sciences station and looked across the <i>Endeavour's</i> bridge to the source of the voice. Pointing to where his attention had been focused, he said, "This device is a viewer, sir. It requires the user to hunch down and look into it. I understand how that might be a new concept to an engineer such as yourself, Commander. You're more used to <i>crawling</i> into things rather than just looking into them." </p><p> Bersh glov Mog released a laugh that sounded more like a belch -- one that rose over the rest of the bridge's ambient noise -- and that was enough to set Klisiewicz to laughing a bit on his own. </p><p> "Well, we all learn by doing," Mog replied, offering the Tellarite equivalent of a smile, which to Klisiewicsz still looked like the fierce rictus of a rabid dog. </p><p> The engineer's sentiment underscored the sense that, in its own slow way, the <i>Endeavour</i> was becoming something of a teaching vessel. Mog seemed to run engineering more as a training lab, mixing up duty rosters and making sure his staff became highly proficient at all aspects of operations rather than focusing on a single area of specialization. Khatami seemed to follow his lead by rotating untried personnel into roles of greater responsibility when opportunities arose. Even Captain Zhao seemed to make himself available to officers fresh out of the Academy, such as Klisiewicz, to discuss matters of life and duty aboard a starship. </p><p> <i>Okay, so maybe not so much in sickbay,</i> he thought, <i>but every place else is pretty open to a new guy like me.</i> </p><p> Two hours into his duty shift, and the chief engineer had started tossing wisecracks across the bridge at his expense. Had the remark come from someone other than Mog, he surely would have held his tongue in reply. While Klisiewicz was becoming fast friends with the Tellarite chief engineer, he noticed in his first scan around the bridge that other than Mog's, there were few familiar faces. </p><p> He knew Commander Khatami, of course, who in Captain Zhao's absence now occupied the <i>Endeavour's</i> center seat, but his conversations with her typically did not stray from whatever task was at hand. Specifically, she was the one to pass to him any information he might need in the course of his duties regarding his continual search for class-V forms of life, otherwise known as anything containing the Taurus meta-genome. Those conversations rarely were chatty; it seemed to be a sobering subject for her, he sensed. </p><p> The communications officer looked familiar, but his name escaped Klisiewicz at the moment, and the navigator, Lieutenant McCormack, well, he did recognize her, as she was one of his favorite objects of secret unrequited affection on the entire ship. </p><p> Turning back to the science console, the ensign noted the white blinking indicator and toggled the controls to transfer the sensor data to an eye-level display. Looking over the readings, he knit his brow before turning to Khatami, who already was regarding him expectantly. </p><p> "Commander," he said, "we're registering a new power reading from the surface." </p><p> "Location?" Khatami asked, spinning her chair to face him. </p><p> Klisiewicz keyed in a few commands, allowing the computer to correlate the sensor data. "It's about five kilometers northwest of the encampment and...about two kilometers beneath the planet's surface." </p><p> "Anything else?" Khatami asked. </p><p> "The energy signature is weak, but pretty distinctive, Commander," Klisiewicz replied as he entered new commands to the console, self-conscious of getting her more information as quickly as he was able. "It's definitely a geothermal source, and it's slowly building in temperature." </p><p> "Keep an eye on it, Ensign," Khatami said, her eyes turning to the main viewer, "Provide regular updates as appropriate, and relay those sensor readings to the survey teams on the surface." </p><p> "Aye, Commander," Klisiewicz said as he keyed the required commands to route the data. The swiftness of a starship's response to human command was something for which he was sure he would never lose a sense of marvel. </p><p> Then another alert indicator flashed on his console. </p><p> "Commander!" he called out to Khatami even as he bent over the hooded viewer once more. Reviewing the new stream of sensor telemetry being fed to his station, he said, "We're picking up a second power reading now." </p><p> "And?" Khatami asked. </p><p> "It's confirmed, sir. Same energy signature as before," he said, checking his calculations. "Bearing due south of the encampment this time, less than five kilometers out." </p><p> "Any ideas, Mr. Mog?" the first officer asked after a moment. "Could they be activating the artifact?" </p><p> "Well, we could ask," the engineer replied before turning back to his station. </p><p> "Mr. Estrada, hail Lieutenant Xiong at the encampment," Khatami said, "and let's see what's going on down there." </p><p> <i>Activate the artifact? Can they</i> do <i>that?</i> </p><p> Klisiewicz involuntarily rubbed his arm as he felt goose bumps rise beneath his sleeves. His thoughts turned to Ravanar IV and the destruction dealt to the research facility there by the Tholians, who apparently had taken issue with a Federation presence on that world. According to what he had learned from rumors and other scuttlebutt around the ship, Lieutenant Xiong, who had been there along with a landing party from the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise</i> investigating the aftermath of an earlier Tholian attack, had barely escaped with his life. </p><p> <i>And Ravanar didn't even have an intact structure,</i> he thought, <i>but the Tholians still wanted us to leave it the hell alone. Could the same thing happen here -- or something worse?</i> As he turned his attention back to the incoming stream of data from the planet's two newly energized power sources, Klisiewicz could not help thinking that someone, somewhere, would learn what was happening on Erilon -- and not like it one bit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Xiong jumped from the driver's seat of the encampment's all-terrain vehicle, his face chilled by icy wind as he made his way quickly to a black, manually operated hatch -- the only distinct feature on the snow-encrusted front of a temporary structure at the base of the artifact. He turned and squinted through the bright white of swirling snow to see his five passengers step out of the side hatch of the vehicle, which had been adapted for use on Erilon with rear treads and an assembly of shock-absorbing skis mounted in place of its front axle. </p><p> He waved them forward, unable to hear any crunching of their boots on the snowpack from the howling of the arctic wind. Xiong had not been on the planet long enough to get a feel for impending white-out conditions, but as he placed his gloved hands on the hatch's center wheel and strained to turn it, he had to wonder whether this was the start of some weather he did not want to witness firsthand. A form stepped alongside him to grip the wheel as well, and they both attempted to turn it again. </p><p> "The automatic locks keep freezing shut!" Xiong yelled over the wind to his helper, whom he now recognized as Captain Zhao. The two tugged to break the wheel loose of the outdoors' frozen grip, and after spinning it freely, Xiong pushed his weight against the door and opened it enough to admit them into the airlock. </p><p> Stepping back so the others could pass, Xiong clanged the hatch shut behind the last of them and started to twist the interior mate to the locking mechanism to seal it. Once the wind's whine was shut out, the room filled with the clatter of feet stamping against floor plates and hands slapping against parkas to loosen the ice crystals that had accumulated on their protective clothing just in the short amount of time they had stood outside. Xiong pushed back the fur-lined hood of his parka and moved to the opposite door. </p><p> "This one's a bit easier," he said, slipping his hand from a glove and keying a security code into a panel next to the door. As it slid open, a rush of warmer air greeted the new arrivals. They made their way briskly into a darkened, ebony-surfaced corridor, one with a graded slope that led under the planet's surface, with Xiong leading them toward a dim source of light and sound several hundred meters into the structure. Their footsteps rang crisply against the smooth floors and walls of the low-ceilinged corridor, and no one spoke as Zhao stepped up into the point position of the group a few strides before they entered the control room, a move that Xiong dismissed as being more out of habit than arrogance. </p><p> "Report," the captain snapped in a voice loud enough to capture the immediate attention of the three researchers in the room. Xiong saw Lieutenant Spencer, the young, blond-haired officer with whom he had worked most closely since his arrival, draw himself up from a crouch next to a power generator and approach the group. </p><p> "Uh...yes, sir," Spencer said hesitantly to Zhao before looking at Xiong. "Isn't this information...?" </p><p> Nodding as he slipped out of his parka, Xiong said, "Captain Zhao's presence is authorized, Spence. Just tell us what's going on." </p><p> Spencer spoke as he turned and walked deeper into the room, prompting Xiong and Zhao to keep up. "When I called you, we'd just picked up a power source activating below the surface a few kilometers from the artifact. We thought that was interesting enough to notify you. But now we have three of them." </p><p> Xiong felt his jaw go slack, and it required physical effort to keep his mouth from dropping open in surprise. <i>"Three?</i> Where?" </p><p> Spencer turned and pointed to the screen of a portable computer viewer propped up on a pitch-black console top in front of them. "One northwest of us and two others south. They're building in output, and we're detecting some deep melt -- there!" Spencer poked at the screen where a blinking amber dot indicated a fourth budding power level, this one situated northeast of the artifact and apparently equidistant from the others. "They jus...</p></p><h2>The Prophecy of Daniel: A Commentary</h2><p>The Prophecy of Daniel commentary by Edward J.

The U.S. and Soviet regimes immediately blamed one another for the disaster; but, as Hersh powerfully argues, responsibility went far beyond ordinary governmental decision making and into the murky sphere of superpower intelligence calculations and confusion. He asserts that the catastrophe followed more from Soviet ignorance than viciousness, and that the whole episode demonstrates how the superpowers are more interested in gaining political advantage than the truest understanding of events. Hersh cannot provide a final recounting of this complex crisis. But he does show how one critical thinker can provide a more believable reconstruction of events than can any self-interested governmental regime.Charles DeBenedetti, History Dept., Univ of Toledo, Ohio<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Essene Way Biogenic Living</h2><p>From the remote ages of antiquity a remarkable teaching has existed which is universal in its application and ageless in its wisdom. Fragments of it are found in Sumerian hieroglyphs and on tiles ans stones dating back some eight of ten thousand years. Some of the symbols, such as for the sun, moon, air, water and other natural forces, are from an even earlier age preceding the cataclysm that ended the Pleistocene period. How many thousands of years previous to that the teaching existed is unknown. To study and practice this teaching is to reawaken within the heart of every man an intuitive knowledge that can solve his individual problems and the problems of the world. Traces of the teaching have appeared in almost every country and religion. Its fundamental principles were taught in ancient Persia, Egypt, India, Tibet, China, Palestine, Greece and many other countries. But it has been transmitted in its most pure form by the Essenes, that mysterious brotherhood which lived during the last two or three centuries B. C. and the first century of the Christian era at the Dead Sea in Palestine and at Lake Mareotis in Egypt. In Palestine and Syria the members of the brotherhood were known as Essenes and in Egypt as Therapeutae, or healers.... From its antiquity, its persistence through the ages, it is evident the teaching could not have been the concept of any individual or any people, but is the interpretation, by a succession of great Teachers, of the Law of the universe, the basic Law, eternal and unchanging as the stars in their course, the same now as two or ten thousand years ago, and as applicable today as then.

The key to skillful action in any situation is in knowing those things that make up the environment and then arranging them so that their power becomes available to us. It is not necessary to change the nature of things to come to victory. Crucial to Sun Tzu's vision is knowledge&#x2014;especially self-knowledge&#x2014;and a view of the whole that seeks to bring the conflicting views around to a vision of the larger perspective. <br><br>This translation preserves the enigmatic quality of the original text, while the accompanying line-by-line commentary and essay reveal the full implications of Sun Tzu's teachings and how they can be applied practically to a broader spectrum of situations. <br><br>The Shambhala Library is a series of exquisitely designed and produced cloth editions of the world's spiritual and literary classics, both ancient and modern. Perfect for collecting or as gifts, each volume features a sewn binding, decorative endsheets, and a ribbon marker&#x2014;a delightful-to-hold 4 � x 6 � trim size.</p><p><i>The Art of War</i> was written over 2,300 years ago in what is now North China. Yet it still remains a contemporary lesson on how to attain victory without going to battle. Modern-day warriors find its ancient strategies helpful regardless of whether the conflict dwells in the boardroom or the bedroom. Despite numerous references to enemies, generals, and armies, <i>The Art of War</i> is about nonaggression. At its core, <i>The Art of War</i> offers a sophisticated lesson on "taking whole," meaning staying openhearted and relaxed in order to sidestep a fight--whether you are a field commander, a CEO, or a frustrated mother putting a resistant son to bed. This particular translation comes from the Denma Translation Group, led by scholars Kidder Smith and James Gimian (publisher of <i>Shambhala Sun</i> magazine). Because of the text's obscure wording (even the Chinese find the original document cumbersome), the translators have inserted helpful commentary that removes some of the linguistic barriers. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>6 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Discovery Of A Continent - Foods, Flavors, And Inspirations From Africa</h2><p>From the front flap of this 174 page book: &#34;Award-winning chef Marcus Samuelsson may be best known for his innovative take on Scandinavian cuisine at New York&#39;s Restaurant Aquavit, but his story begins thousands of miles away, in Africa.

McKie is captured by a ruthless woman whose plan to escape Dosadi involves her changing bodies with McKie</p><p><b>Frank Herbert</b> created one of the most beloved novels in the annals of science fiction, <i>Dune</i>. He was a man of many facets, of countless passageways that ran through an intricate mind. His magnum opus is a reflection of this, a classic work that stands as one of the most complex, multi-layered novels ever written in any genre. Today the novel is more popular than ever, with new readers continually discovering it and telling their friends to pick up a copy. It has been translated into dozens of languages and has sold almost 20 million copies.<p><em>Justice belongs to those who claim it, but let the claimant beware lest he create new injustice by his claim and thus set the bloody pendulum of revenge into its inexorable motion</em>.<br>--Gowachin aphorism<br>Why are you so cold and mechanical in your Human relationships?&#x201d;<br><br>Jorj X. McKie was to reflect on that Caleban question later. Had she been trying to alert him to the Dosadi Experiment and to what his investigation of that experiment might do to him? He hadn&#x2019;t even known about Dosadi at the time and the pressures of the Caleban communications trance, the accusatory tone she took, had precluded other considerations.<br><br>Still, it rankled. He didn&#x2019;t like the feeling that he might be a subject of her research into Humans. He&#x2019;d always thought of that particular Caleban as his friend--if one could consider being friendly with a creature whose visible manifestation in this universe was a fourth-magnitude yellow sun visible from Central Central where the Bureau of Sabotage maintained its headquarters. And there was inevitable discomfort in Caleban communication. You sank into a trembling, jerking trance while they made their words appear in your consciousness.<br><br>But his uncertainty remained: had she tried to tell him something beyond the plain content of her words?<br><br>When the weather makers kept the evening rain period short, McKie liked to go outdoors immediately afterward and stroll in the park enclosure which BuSab provided for its employees on Central Central. As a Saboteur Extraordinary, McKie had free run of the enclosure and he liked the fresh smells of the place after a rain.<br><br>The park covered about thirty hectares, deep in a well of Bureau buildings. It was a scrambling hodgepodge of plantings cut by wide paths which circled and twisted through specimens from every inhabited planet of the known universe. No care had been taken to provide a particular area for any sentient species. If there was any plan to the park it was a maintenance plan with plants requiring similar conditions and care held in their own sectors. Giant Spear Pines from Sasak occupied a knoll near one corner surrounded by mounds of Flame Briar from Rudiria. There were bold stretches of lawn and hidden scraps of lawn, and some flat stretches of greenery which were not lawns at all but mobile sheets of predatory leaf imprisoned behind thin moats of caustic water.<br><br>Rain-jeweled flowers often held McKie&#x2019;s attention to the exclusion of all else. There was a single planting of Lilium Grossa, its red blossoms twice his height casting long shadows over a wriggling carpet of blue Syringa, each miniature bloom opening and closing at random like tiny mouths gasping for air.<br><br>Sometimes, floral perfumes stopped his progress and held him in a momentary olfactory thralldom while his eyes searched out the source. As often as not, the plant would be a dangerous one--a flesh eater or poison-sweat variety. Warning signs in flashing Galach guarded such plantings. Sonabarriers, moats, and force fields edged the winding paths in many areas.<br><br>McKie had a favorite spot in the park, a bench with its back to a fountain where he could sit and watch the shadows collect across fat yellow bushes from the floating islands of Tandaloor. The yellow bushes thrived because their roots were washed in running water hidden beneath the soil and renewed by the fountain. Beneath the yellow bushes there were faint gleams of phosphorescent silver enclosed by a force field and identified by a low sign:<br><br>&#x201c;Sangeet Mobilus, a blood-sucking perennial from Bisaj. Extreme danger to all sentient species. Do not intrude any portion of your body beyond the force field.&#x201d;<br><br>As he sat on the bench, McKie thought about that sign. The universe often mixed the beautiful and the dangerous. This was a deliberate mixture in the park. The yellow bushes, the fragrant and benign Golden Iridens, had been mingled with Sangeet Mobilus. The two supported each other and both thrived. The ConSentient government which McKie served often made such mixtures...sometimes by accident.<br><br>Sometimes by design.<br><br>He listened to the splashing of the fountain while the shadows thickened and the tiny border lights came on along the paths. The tops of the buildings beyond the park became a palette where the sunset laid out its final display of the day.<br><br>In that instant, the Caleban contact caught him and he felt his body slip into the helpless communications trance. The mental tendrils were immediately identified--Fannie Mae. And he thought, as he often had, what an improbable name that was for a star entity. He heard no sounds, but his hearing centers responded as to spoken words, and the inward glow was unmistakable. It was Fannie Mae, her syntax far more sophisticated than during their earliest encounters.<br><br>&#x201c;You admire one of us,&#x201c; she said, indicating his attention on the sun which had just set beyond the buildings.<br><br>&#x201c;I try not to think of any star as a Caleban,&#x201c; he responded. &#x201c;It interferes with my awareness of the natural beauty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Natural? McKie, you don&#x2019;t understand your own awareness, nor even how you employ it!&#x201d;<br><br>That was her beginning--accusatory, attacking, unlike any previous contact with this Caleban he&#x2019;d thought of as friend. And she employed her verb forms with new deftness, almost as though showing off, parading her understanding of his language.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you want, Fannie Mae?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I consider your relationships with females of your species. You have entered marriage relationships which number more than fifty. Not so?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. Yes. Why do you...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am your friend, McKie. What is your feeling toward me?&#x201d;<br><br>He thought about that. There was a demanding intensity in her question. He owed his life to this Caleban with an improbable name. For that matter, she owed her life to him. Together, they&#x2019;d resolved the Whipping Star threat. Now, many Calebans provided the jumpdoors by which other beings moved in a single step from planet to planet, but once Fannie Mae had held all of those jumpdoor threads, her life threatened through the odd honor code by which Calebans maintained their contractual obligations. And McKie had saved her life. He had but to think about their past interdependence and a warm sense of camaraderie suffused him.<br><br>Fannie Mae sensed this.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, McKie, that is friendship, is love. Do you possess this feeling toward Human female companions?&#x201d;<br><br>Her question angered him. Why was she prying? His private sexual relationships were no concern of hers!<br><br>&#x201c;Your love turns easily to anger,&#x201c; she chided.<br><br>&#x201c;There are limits to how deeply a Saboteur Extraordinary can allow himself to be involved with anyone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which came first, McKie--the Saboteur Extraordinary or these limits?&#x201d;<br><br>Her response carried obvious derision. Had he chosen the Bureau because he was incapable of warm relationships? But he really cared for Fannie Mae! He admired her...and she could hurt him because he admired her and felt...felt <em>this way</em>.<br><br>He spoke out of his anger and hurt.<br><br>&#x201c;Without the Bureau there&#x2019;d be no ConSentiency and no need for Calebans.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, indeed. People have but to look at a dread agent from BuSab and know fear.&#x201d;<br><br>It was intolerable, but he couldn&#x2019;t escape the underlying warmth he felt toward this strange Caleban entity, this being who could creep unguarded into his mind and talk to him as no other being dared. If only he had found a woman to share that kind of intimacy...<br><br>And this was the part of their conversation which came back to haunt him. After months with no contact between them, why had she chosen that moment--just three days before the Dosadi crisis burst upon the Bureau? She&#x2019;d pulled out his ego, his deepest sense of identity. She&#x2019;d shaken that ego and then she&#x2019;d skewered him with her barbed question:<br><br>&#x201c;<em>Why are you so cold and mechanical in your Human relationships</em>?&#x201d;<br><br>Her irony could not be evaded. She&#x2019;d made him appear ridiculous in his own eyes. He could feel warmth, yes...even love, for a Caleban but not for a Human female. This unguarded feeling he held for Fannie Mae had never been directed at any of his marital companions. Fannie Mae had aroused his anger, then reduced his anger to verbal breast-beating, and finally to silent hurt. Still, the love remained.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Human females were bed partners. They were bodies which used him and which he used. That was out of the question with this Caleban. She was a star burning with atomic fires, her seat of consciousness unimaginable to other sentients. Yet, she could extract love from him. He gave this love freely and she knew it. There was no hiding an emotion from a Caleban when she sent her mental tendrils into your awareness.<br><br>She&#x2019;d certainly known he would see the irony. That had to be part of her motive in such an attack. But Calebans seldom acted from a single motive--which was part of their charm and the essence of their most irritant exchanges with other sentient beings.<br><br>&#x201c;McKie?&#x201d; Softly in his mind.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Angry.<br><br>&#x201c;I show you now a fractional bit of my feeling toward your node.&#x201d;<br><br>Like a balloon being inflated by a swift surge of gas, he felt himself suffused by a projected sense of concern, of caring. He was drowning in it...wanted to drown in it. His entire body radiated this white-hot sense of protective attention. For a whole minute after it was withdrawn, he still glowed with it.<br><br><em>A fractional bit</em>?<br><br>&#x201c;McKie?&#x201d; <em>Concerned?</em>.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&amp;rdquo...</p></p><h2>Traveling Without A Spare: A Survivor&#39;s Guide to Navigating the Post-Polio Journey</h2><p>Decades after recovering from polio, many aging Americans are grappling with an emergence of new pain, weakness, and fatigue.

This book examines the immensity of Homer&#39;s artistic accomplishments, focusing not only on his masterpieces in various media but also on the suites of works on the same subject that reflect the artist&#39;s essentially modern practices of thinking and working serially and thematically.</p><p>The 19th-century realist Winslow Homer first gained wide renown with his Civil War battlefield illustrations in Harper's Weekly. A year spent in Paris after the war led to a greater acuity of vision, and by the mid-1870s he was one of the leading progenitors of naturalism and the most celebrated American painter of his day. Known for his watercolors, which have all the intensity and ardor of the most accomplished oil paintings, the solid outlines and luminosity of his surfaces show little influence from his contemporaries the Impressionists. His art was unquestionably individual and native. He was a reclusive outdoorsman who captured dozens of scenes highlighting the milieus he loved: seafaring vessels, Adirondack and Canadian hunting grounds, Bahamian beaches, and the rocky coast of Maine, to which he retreated in his last years. This outstanding new book is the catalog of a retrospective of 235 paintings touring East Coast museums?the largest gathering of his work ever. Cikovsky and Kelly (curators of American and British art at the National Gallery of Art) divide his career into eight chronological chapters, each with a straightforward, expository essay securely planting the work in a geographical and biographical context. The format is large but unostentatious, striking the perfect balance between text and illustration. This is easily the fairest, most intelligent, and best survey to date on this popular American master.?Douglas F. Smith, Oakland P.L., Cal.<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Winslow Homer (1836^-1910) was in the news as a comprehensive retrospective of his magnificent paintings and watercolors opened at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., an exhibition that will live on between the covers of this spectacular volume. Cikovsky and Kelly, curators at the National Gallery, present a contextually rich and vibrant analysis of Homer's life and groundbreaking work. A self-taught artist with an "almost sensuous love of paint," Homer, like so many of his contemporaries, was deeply affected by the Civil War. His early illustrations and paintings demonstrate his "technical strength and assurance; color, modeling, and drawing; truthfulness, and lack of sentimentality," qualities he would elevate to new levels as he moved on to paint candid scenes of everyday life. There is an earthy grace to his dignified, hardworking figures, many of whom gaze contemplatively out into the distance, a gaze not unlike that of the artist himself. The authors track Homer's major themes, all of which are intrinsically connected to place, and discuss the progression from ideology to aesthetics, from shimmering pastoral romance to dark and stormy seas. Homer was a master not only of technique but also of interpreting light, motion, and our complex relationship with nature. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Small Great Things</h2><p>&#39;There is a fire raging, and we have two choices: we can turn our backs, or we can try to fight it.&#39; When a newborn baby dies after a routine hospital procedure, there is no doubt about who will be held responsible: the nurse who had been banned from looking after him by his father.

As a middle story, it is written with the expectation that you already know that the hero, Kyle Katarn, is an ex-storm trooper who defected to the Rebellion after his father was brutally murdered by the Empire. But <i>Rebel Agent</i> actually begins with a flashback to the years before the action of the trilogy. Kyle's father, Morgan, stumbles onto the legendary Valley of the Jedi while fleeing an Imperial crackdown on Sulon. The Valley is a resting place for thousands of ancient Jedi souls, and its potential power as a tool for good or evil will remind readers of the ark of the covenant in <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>. After making a map, Morgan hides his discovery since he knows that the ascendant Empire is likely to make use of it long before the struggling rebels can.</p><p> The story then shifts to the days after Kyle's first successful rebel mission (detailed in <i>Soldier for the Empire</i>). From a scheming droid named 8t88--and through communications with a ghostly Jedi named Rahn--Kyle learns of the Valley and is drafted by Luke Skywalker and Mon Mothma to find his father's map at all costs. The action intensifies as Kyle--now a Jedi-in-training--races with Jerec and his band of Dark Jedi to uncover the coordinates of the Valley.</p><p> One of the best parts of <i>Dark Forces</i> is Dietz's characterization of the Empire, and in this volume it is the power-hungry droid, 8t88, who steals the show with lines like: "The malfunction is in your skull, a difficult place to make repairs.... A CPU makes more sense." In the end, though, the book is not as strong as the first and third volumes. One wonders, for example, why the budding romance between Kyle and Jan is interrupted by their long separations. Also, while Ezra Tucker's paintings perfectly capture the tattooed, lined face of Jerec, they are often cartoonish in comparison to Dean Williams's hyperrealism in the first volume.

What emerges is a fascinating picture of a man constantly torn between benevolence and malevolence -- a man who made himself cultured and yet who could never really escape his image as a bullying country bumpkin (most famously demonstrated by his interruption of Macmillan&#39;s speech to the UN in 1960 by banging his shoe on the table -- the urbane Macmillan responded, &#39;Mr President, perhaps we could have a translation, I could not quite follow&#39;). William Taubman has previously edited collections of Nikita Khrushchev&#39;s speeches and reminiscences and is completely immersed in this subject -- his biography is likely to remain the standard work for years to come.</p><p>William Taubman is the Bertrand Snell Professor of Political Science at Amherst College. In addition to having spent fifteen years researching this volume, Taubman is the author of STALIN&#39;S AMERICAN POLICY (1982) and MOSCOW SPRING (1989).Amherst College political science professor Taubman's thorough and nuanced account is the first full-length American biography of Khrushchev-and will likely be the definitive one for a long time. Russians, Taubman explains, are still divided by Khrushchev's legacy, largely because of the great contradiction at the heart of his career: he worked closely with Stalin for nearly 20 years, approved thousands of arrests and executions, and continued to idolize the dictator until the latter's death. Yet it was Khrushchev who publicly revealed the enormity of Stalin's crimes, denounced him, and introduced reforms that, Taubman argues, "allowed a nascent civil society to take shape"-eventually making way for perestroika. Taubman untangles the fascinating layers of deception and self-deception in Khrushchev's own memoir, weighing just how much the leader was likely to have known about the purges and his own culpability in them. He also shows that shadows of Stalinism lingered through Khrushchev's 11 years in power: his fourth-grade education left him both awed and threatened by the Russian intelligentsia, which he persecuted; intending to de-escalate the Cold War, the mercurial, blustering first secretary ended up provoking dangerous standoffs with the U.S. The bumbling, equivocal speeches quoted here make Khrushchev seem a rank amateur in international affairs-or, as Taubman politely puts it, he had trouble "thinking things through." Working closely with Khrushchev's children, and interviewing his surviving top-level Central Committee colleagues and aides, Taubman has pieced together a remarkably detailed chronicle, complete with riveting scenes of Kremlin intrigue and acute psychological analysis that further illuminates some of the nightmarish episodes of Soviet history. 32 pages of photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A History of Engraving and Etching (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)</h2><p><p>Arthur Mayger Hind (1880&#x2013;1957) was a leading historian of engraving, one of the most highly respected art historians of modern times. Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum and Professor of Fine Art at Oxford, he was the author of the most complete history of etching and engraving that has yet been written. This book, formerly out of print for many years, contains references to every etcher or engraver worthy of mention from the early fifteenth century to 1914, and it gives a fair account of influences, artistic repercussions, and accomplishments of each individual.<br>Beginning with a chapter on processes and methods of the twin arts, in which he covers line-engraving, etching, biting and stopping-out, tone processes, the tools used in the various methods, and so on, the author proceeds with a text that is fabled among artists, art historians, teachers, and students for its richness of detail and the brilliance of its author&#x2019;s obvious genius for research and criticism. He begins with the anonymous engravers of the fifteenth century, moves through Holland, Italy, and Germany to the great masters of engraving and the beginnings of etching in the sixteenth century, through the portrait engravers, master etchers, the practitioners of mezzotint, aquatint, crayon manner and stipple, and color print makers, to modern etching in the period prior to World War I. All along the way there are illustrations: over 100 magnificent works by D�rer, Finiguerra, Cranach, Lucas Van Leyden, Parmigiano, Van Dyck, Rembrandt, van Ruysdael, Blake, Tiepolo, Piranesi, Turner, Boucher, Goya, Millet, Whistler, and scores of others. All but seven of these plates have been reproduced from new photographs and are even sharper and clearer than those in the original editions of Hind's great text.<br>As an aid to students of art history, there is a massive Index of more than 2,500 artists mentioned in the text, with their dates and brief individual biographical data. Furthermore, there is a classified chronological list, arranged by country, of important artists, movements, and styles, and the engravers and etchers who were influenced by them. Finally, there is a bibliography that is valuable for further reference work.</p></p><p></p><h2>Days of Hope</h2><p>In the 1930s and 1940s, a loose alliance of blacks and whites, individuals and organizations, came together to offer a radical alternative to southern conservative politics. In <i>Days of Hope</i>, Patricia Sullivan traces the rise and fall of this movement. Using oral interviews with participants in this movement as well as documentary sources, she demonstrates that the New Deal era inspired a coalition of liberals, black activists, labor organizers, and Communist Party workers who sought to secure the New Deal's social and economic reforms by broadening the base of political participation in the South. From its origins in a nationwide campaign to abolish the poll tax, the initiative to expand democracy in the South developed into a regional drive to register voters and elect liberals to Congress. The NAACP, the CIO Political Action Committee, and the Southern Conference for Human Welfare coordinated this effort, which combined local activism with national strategic planning. Although it dramatically increased black voter registration and led to some electoral successes, the movement ultimately faltered, according to Sullivan, because the anti-Communist fervor of the Cold War and a militant backlash from segregationists fractured the coalition and marginalized southern radicals. Nevertheless, the story of this campaign invites a fuller consideration of the possibilities and constraints that have shaped the struggle for racial democracy in America since the 1930s.<br><br></p><p>"Sullivan effectively explores the campaigns to abolish the poll tax, build industrial unions, win protections for Southern tenant farmers and sharecroppers, uphold the wartime prohibition on discrimination in wartime industries and register Southern black voters and democratize the South."-- <i>Chicago Tribune</i> <br>In the 1930s and 1940s, a loose alliance of blacks and whites, individuals and organizations, came together to offer a potent alternative to southern conservative politics. &#39;Days of Hope&#39; traces the rise and fall of this movement that helped shape the struggle for racial democracy in America.</p><h2>Cool Town: How Athens, Georgia, Launched Alternative Music and Changed American Culture</h2><p>In the summer of 1978, the B-52's conquered the New York underground. A year later, the band's self-titled debut album burst onto the <i>Billboard</i> charts, capturing the imagination of fans and music critics worldwide. The fact that the group had formed in the sleepy southern college town of Athens, Georgia, only increased the fascination. Soon, more Athens bands followed the B-52's into the vanguard of the new American music that would come to be known as "alternative," including R.E.M., who catapulted over the course of the 1980s to the top of the musical mainstream. As acts like the B-52's, R.E.M., and Pylon drew the eyes of New York tastemakers southward, they discovered in Athens an unexpected mecca of music, experimental art, DIY spirit, and progressive politics--a creative underground as vibrant as any to be found in the country's major cities. <br><br>In Athens in the eighties, if you were young and willing to live without much money, anything seemed possible. <i>Cool Town</i> reveals the passion, vitality, and enduring significance of a bohemian scene that became a model for others to follow. Grace Elizabeth Hale experienced the Athens scene as a student, small-business owner, and band member. Blending personal recollection with a historian's eye, she reconstructs the networks of bands, artists, and friends that drew on the things at hand to make a new art of the possible, transforming American culture along the way. In a story full of music and brimming with hope, Hale shows how an unlikely cast of characters in an unlikely place made a surprising and beautiful new world.<br><br></p><p>Grace Elizabeth Hale is the Commonwealth Professor of American Studies and History at the University of Virginia. Her previous books include <i>A Nation of Outsiders: How the White Middle Class Fell in Love with Rebellion in Postwar America</i> and <i>Making Whiteness: The Culture of Segregation in the South, 1890&#x2013;1940</i>.An absolutely brilliant account of an essential American scene--one that helped define what was hip and cool in the 1980s. Hale's story of Athens and why it matters is smart, probing, revealing, moving, fun, propulsive, and engaging.--Bryant Simon, author of <i>The Hamlet Fire: A Tragic Story of Cheap Food, Cheap Government, and Cheap Lives</i><br>Not only is&nbsp;<i>Cool Town</i>&nbsp;the most detailed account we'll get of the music of Athens, Georgia, the out-of-the-way college town that gave us the B-52's and R.E.M. It's also a thorough, deeply felt&nbsp;history of&nbsp;a seminal&nbsp;local bohemia&nbsp;that even as it matured changed the surrounding culture more than that culture changed it.--Robert Christgau<br>In&nbsp;<i>Cool Town</i>, Grace Hale captures the heyday of the Athens scene as she lived it: vibrant, surprising, full of possibility. The relationships formed, the songs and stories spun, the art created, the uncertainty embraced&#x2014;all that continues to inspire four decades later. Hale doesn't merely recall what happened. She explains it as well as one can. This remembrance of things not passed resonates all these years later and results in an essential read."&#x2014;Bertis Downs, adviser, R.E.M.<br>'It was like New York City, only safer and cheaper.' This is the axiom American bohemia runs on--in few places more brilliantly than Athens, Georgia, in the eighties. From the B-52's reconfiguring drag as dance-punk to R.E.M. 'translating postmodern theory into sonic form,' to both bands' bittersweet commercial apexes, Hale's clear-eyed, heart-full testament depicts an era so radiant it felt like it could live a million years.--Michaelangelo Matos, author of <i>Can't Slow Down: How 1984 Became Pop's Blockbuster Year</i><br>A delightful dive into the rich history of the Athens, Georgia, music and arts scene that has nurtured and inspired so many. Grace Hale experienced the scene firsthand, and her recollections are warm, but she doesn't shy away from difficult subjects. I was honored by her inclusion of Pylon as a central part of the story."&#x2014;Vanessa Briscoe Hay, vocalist, Pylon and Pylon Reenactment Society<br><br></p><h2>Called to Question: A Spiritual Memoir</h2><p><i>Called to Question</i> is Sr. Joan Chittister's most personal and intense writing to date. Centered around a series of conversations with spiritual writers featured in her private journal, Sr. Joan looks at the common questions or dimensions of life as we know them in our daily lives-not answers as we've been given them-in an attempt to unravel their many meanings, to give them flesh, to honor their spiritual import now and here, in our time and in our own lives. By sharing the questions, doubts, and convictions in her own heart, Chittister explores the heart of faith itself and nurtures a spirituality that pushes readers beyond superficial questioning and unexamined faith. <br><br>The paperback edition includes a new Prologue about the power of questions in today's society. Following a moving prologue on the nature of faith, <i>Called to Question</i> is broken into six parts that explore key themes- the inward life, immersion in life, resistance, feminist spirituality, ecology, dailiness. Within each theme is a wide array of topics that embody Sr. Joan's life's work as a sociologist, theologian, Benedictine nun, rights activist, and spiritual guide to countless people throughout the world. Alive with the raw energy of a journal and polished with the skill of a master storyteller, each chapter is an engaging dialogue between Sr. Joan and many different wisdom sources about such topics as God's existence and call, experience, struggle, justice, the role of women and men in society and church, living through doubt, and celebrating life. <i>Called to Question</i> is a rare and powerful invitation to look into the center of our own souls, name our questions about God and life, admit the worst, and pursue the best&#x2015;even when we are unsure where that pursuit will take us.</p><p><b>Joan Chittister</b> is a Benedictine sister, best-selling author, and a well-known national and international lecturer. In 2007 she was awarded the Outstanding Leadership Award from The Leadership Conference of Women Religious.Some leading figures (like the Pope) never say, 'I don't know;' others (like the Dalai Lama) say it surprisingly often. Joan Chittister admirably demonstrates the sparkling wisdom which springs from befriending our uncertainty. Page after page, her spirited questioning makes us feel joyfully alive. (Brother David Steindl-Rast, O.S.B., senior member of Mount Savior Monastery, active participant in and author of several works on Buddhist-Christian dialogue)<br><br>In <i>Called to Question</i>, Joan Chittister calls us to enter deeply into ourselves as she enters into herself in this memoir that bears the compelling marks of a spiritual classic of our time. Already one of the true voices of the post-Vatican II age, she speaks to us as Woman, as Church, as Spiritual Guide but, most of all, following the mystical poet Blake, in a voice that cleanses the doors of perception so that we may see the universe as it is, infinite. Joan understands that religion is not the work of the will but of the imagination and that the Church is the sacrament of the world, just as it is. Read this to know Joan Chittister better, to know yourself more truly, and to grasp the meaning of sacramental faith more deeply. (Eugene Kennedy, Ph.D., award-winning author, syndicated columnist, and professor emeritus of psychology at Loyola University)<br><br>This candid memoir takes us immediately back to the challenging spirit of the gospels. Sister Joan reminds us that we have a religious duty to question any authority, however august, and to overturn the idols of orthodoxy. This wise, charitable, and humane book will give hope to anybody who has felt diminished by institutionalized religion. (Karen Armstrong, bestselling author of <i>A History of God<i>)<br><br>Chittister expertly and succinctly discusses the differences between religion, which she sees as an institution, and spirituality, which transcends dogma and creed, she says, and dwells in the heart. She reflects upon love and friendship, solitude and contemplation, power and evil, ecology and nature, and ultimately promotes a feminist spirituality to save the world from looming mass destruction.

Now, in his first book written for a wide audience, he offers a marvelous biography of the Prophet Muhammad, one that highlights the spiritual and ethical teachings of one of the most influential figures in human history.<br> <br><em>In the Footsteps of the Prophet</em> is a fresh and perceptive look at Muhammad, capturing a life that was often eventful, gripping, and highly charged. Ramadan provides both an intimate portrait of a man who was shy, kind, but determined, as well as a dramatic chronicle of a leader who launched a great religion and inspired a vast empire. More important, Ramadan presents the main events of the Prophet's life in a way that highlights his spiritual and ethical teachings. The book underscores the significance of the Prophet's example for some of today's most controversial issues, such as the treatment of the poor, the role of women, Islamic criminal punishments, war, racism, and relations with other religions. Selecting those facts and stories from which we can draw a profound and vivid spiritual picture, the author asks how can the Prophet's life remain -- or become again -- an example, a model, and an inspiration? And how can Muslims move from formalism -- a fixation on ritual -- toward a committed spiritual and social presence?<br> <br>In this thoughtful and engaging biography, Ramadan offers Muslims a new understanding of Muhammad's life and he introduces non-Muslims not just to the story of the Prophet, but to the spiritual and ethical riches of Islam.<br></p><p><br>Tariq Ramadan is a Research Fellow at St. Antony's College, Oxford University and the Lokahi Foundation (London).

I walked into the kitchen and found her sitting at the table. No lights were on, but in the thin haze of dawn that pushed through the frostbitten window, I could see red high-heeled shoes peeking out from beneath the hem of her robe. There was no breakfast waiting, and no freshly ironed school dress hanging on the basement doorknob. Momma just sat and stared out the window with empty eyes, her hands limp in her lap, her coffee cold and untouched.</p><p>I stood by her side and breathed in the sweet scent of lavender talcum powder that clung to the tufts of her robe. </p><p>"What's the matter, Momma?"</p><p>I waited and waited. Finally she turned from the window and looked at me. Her skin was as frail as tissue, and her voice wasn't much more than a whisper when she smoothed her hand over my cheek and said, "Cecelia Rose, I'm taking you to Georgia. I want you to see what real living is like. All the women dress so nice. And the people are kind and friendly&#x2014;it's so different from how things are here. As soon as I feel better, we'll plan a trip&#x2014;just you and me."</p><p>"But what about Dad, will he come too?"</p><p>She squeezed her eyes closed and didn't answer.</p><p>Momma stayed sad for the rest of the winter. Just when I thought she'd never smile again, spring came. When the lilacs bloomed in great, fluffy waves of violet, Momma went outside and cut bouquets for every room in the house. She painted her fingernails bright pink, fixed her hair, and slipped into a flowery-print dress. From room to room she dashed, pushing back curtains and throwing open the windows. She turned up the volume of the radio, took hold of my hands, and danced me through the house.</p><p>We whirled through the living room, into the dining room, and around the table. Right in the middle of a spin, Momma abruptly stopped. "Oh, my gosh," she said, taking in a big gulp of air and pointing to the mirror by the door, "we look so much alike. When did that happen? When did you start to grow up?"</p><p>We stood side by side and gazed at our reflections. What I saw was two smiling people with the same heart-shaped face, blue eyes, and long brown hair&#x2014;Momma's pulled away from her face in a headband and mine tied back in a ponytail.</p><p>"It's amazing," my mother said, gathering her hair in her hand and holding it back in a ponytail like mine. "Just look at us, CeeCee. I bet when you get older, people will think we're sisters. Won't that be fun?" She giggled, took hold of my hands, and spun me in circles till my feet lifted off the floor.</p><p>She was so happy that after we finished dancing, she took me into town and bought all sorts of new clothes and ribbons for my hair. Momma bought herself so many pairs of new shoes that the salesman laughed and said, "Mrs. Honeycutt, I believe you have more shoes than the Bolshoi Ballet." Neither Momma nor I knew what that meant, but the salesman sure thought he was clever. So we laughed along with him as he helped us carry our packages to the car.</p><p>After stuffing the trunk full with bags and boxes, we ran across the street to the five-and-dime, where we sat at the lunch counter and shared a cheeseburger, a bowl of French fries, and a chocolate milkshake.</p><p>That spring sure was something. I'd never seen Momma so happy. Every day was a big celebration. I'd come home from school and she'd be waiting, all dressed up with a big smile on her face. She'd grab her handbag, hurry me to her car, and off we'd go to do more shopping.</p><p>Then came the day when Dad arrived home from a three-week business trip. Momma and I were sitting at the kitchen table, she with a magazine and me with a coloring book and crayons. When my dad opened the closet door to hang up his jacket, he was all but knocked senseless when an avalanche of shoeboxes rained down on him.</p><p>"Good Christ!" he barked, turning to look at Momma. "How much money have you been spending?"</p><p>When Momma didn't answer, I put down my crayon and smiled. "Daddy, we've been shopping for weeks, but everything we got was for free."</p><p>"Free? What are you talking about?"</p><p>I nodded wisely. "Yep. All Momma had to do was show the salesman a square of plastic, and he let us have whatever we wanted."</p><p>"What the hell?" Dad pounded across the kitchen floor, yanked Momma's handbag from the hook by the door, and pulled the square of plastic from her wallet. "Damn it, Camille," he said, cutting it up with a pair of scissors. "How many times do I have to tell you? This has got to stop. No more credit cards. You keep this up and you'll put us in the poor house. You hear me?"</p><p>Momma licked her finger and turned a page of the magazine.</p><p>He leaned down and looked at her. "Have you been taking your pills?" She ignored him and turned another page. "Camille, I'm talking to you."</p><p>The sharpness of his words wiped the shine right out of her eyes.</p><p>Dad shook his head and pulled a beer from the refrigerator. He huffed and puffed out of the kitchen, kicking shoes out of his way as he headed for the living room. I heard him dump his wide, beefy body into the recliner, muttering the way he always did whenever he was in a bad mood. Which, as far as I could tell, was pretty much always.</p><p>My father didn't smile or laugh very much, and he had a limitless gift for making me feel about as important as a lost penny on the sidewalk. Whenever I'd show him a drawing I'd made or try to tell him about something I'd learned in school, he'd get fidgety and say, "I'm tired. We'll talk another time."</p><p>But another time never came.</p><p>He was a machine-tool salesman and spent much of his time in places like Michigan and Indiana. Usually he'd stay away all week and would come home only on weekends. And most times those weekends were filled with an unbearable tension that sprung loose on Saturday night.</p><p>Momma would get all dolled up, walk into the living room, and beg him to take her out. "C'mon Carl," she'd say, tugging at his arm, "let's go dancing like we used to. We never have fun anymore."</p><p>His face would turn sour and he'd say, "No, Camille. I'm not taking you anywhere until you straighten up. Now go take your pills."</p><p>She'd cry and say she didn't need any pills, he'd get mad, turn up the volume of the TV, and drink one beer after another, and I'd run upstairs and hide in my bedroom. Whole months would go by and I'd hear only an occasional kind word pass between them. Even less frequently I'd see them touch. Before too long even those things faded away, and my father's presence in the house faded right along with them.</p><p>Momma seemed glad that Dad stayed away so much. One day I was sitting on the floor of her bedroom cutting out paper dolls while she sat at her vanity and put on makeup. "Who needs him anyway?" she said, leaning close to the mirror as she smoothed on bright red lipstick. "I'll tell you something, Cecelia Rose. Northerners are exactly like their weather&#x2014;cold and boring. And I swear, none of them has one iota of etiquette or propriety. Do you know that not one single person in this godforsaken town even knows I'm a pageant queen? They're all a bunch of sticks-in-the-mud, just like your father."</p><p> "You don't like Daddy anymore?"</p><p>"No," she said, turning to look at me. "I don't."</p><p>"He doesn't come home very much. Where is he, Momma?"</p><p>She blotted her lips with a tissue. "That old fool? He's not here because he's down at the cemetery with one foot stuck in the grave. And that's another thing. Never marry an older man. I mean it, CeeCee. If an older man ever sweeps you off your feet, just get up and run away as fast as you can."</p><p>I set down my scissors. "How old is Daddy?"</p><p>"Fifty-seven," she said, rubbing a smudge of rouge from her cheek. "And look what he's done to me." She scowled at her reflection in the mirror and shook her head. "I'm only thirty-three and I already have lines on my face. Your father is nothing but a Yankee liar. I can't tell you how many promises he made just so I'd marry him and move up here to this god-awful excuse for a town. But all those promises amounted to nothing but a five-hundred-pound bag of dog breath."</p><p>As I was about to ask her what that meant, a strange, icy expression moved across her face. She gazed down at her wedding picture and slowly lifted it from the vanity. With her tube of lipstick she drew a big red X over my dad's face, then shrieked with laughter, fluffed her hair, and walked out the door.</p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>The Decorated Journal: Creating Beautifully Expressive Journal Pages</h2><p>This follow-up to the highly popular <i>Decorated Page </i>offers even more great ideas for beautifying a journal, more breathtaking photos to inspire, and more smart (and simple) ways to endow even the artistically timid with confidence.

They reveal lives where dreams, memory and chance can lead to horrifying consequences; worlds where obsession and dark tensions seethe just beneath the surface.</p><p>Claire Keegan was born in 1968 and grew up on a farm in Wicklow. Her first collection of short stories, <i>Antarctica</i>, was completed in 1998. It announced her as an exceptionally gifted and versatile writer of contemporary fiction and was awarded the Rooney Prize for Literature. Her second short story collection, <i>Walk the Blue Fields</i>, was published to enormous critical acclaim in 2007 and won her the 2008 Edge Hill Prize for Short Stories. Claire Keegan lives in County Wexford, Ireland.The chill reaches to the bones of this debut collection of 15 stories by Keegan, an acclaimed young Irish writer whose precisely articulated, clear prose illuminates her native land. In Keegan's Ireland, it is eternally winter, and familial relations provide neither appeasing warmth nor protection. Her mostly female narrators dwell on the cusp of self-knowledge; they have ruefully observed the example set by their mothers, aunts and grandmothers "flat-bellied, temperamental women who've given up and call it happiness" and are slowly feeling out new possibilities for their own lives. Rebellions range from the small and symbolic (a mother takes the wheel of a car and leaves her husband stranded) to the wider-reaching (a woman decides to keeps her illegitimate child). Such victories cannot keep the harshness of the world at bay and are of little help, for example, to the couple whose daughter is kidnapped. Yet Keegan depicts the ascendance of a generation of women who "can butt in and take over, rescue and be rescued" in an Ireland on the verge of a self-generated wave of feminism. The setting of several stories in the U.S. (where Keegan did her undergraduate work) is indicated only by a smattering of details such as baseball hats and fast food; they might as well, and with greater effect, have been set in Ireland. While Keegan's imagery occasionally bears the clear brand of the M.F.A. program, these moments are few and are outweighed by the restraint with which she deploys such imagery, and by her stern refusal to fall back on anything that might resemble a happy ending. (July) Forecast: Keegan is a comer in Ireland, where she won both the William Trevor Prize and the Rooney Prize in 2000. A keen and unflinching observer, she will appeal to fans of Roddy Doyle. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Carolina Israelite: How Harry Golden Made Us Care About Jews, the South, and Civil Rights</h2><p>This first comprehensive biography of Jewish American writer and humorist Harry Golden (1903-1981)--author of the 1958 national best-seller <i>Only in America</i>--illuminates a remarkable life intertwined with the rise of the civil rights movement, Jewish popular culture, and the sometimes precarious position of Jews in the South and across America during the 1950s.<br><br>After recounting Golden's childhood on New York's Lower East Side, Kimberly Marlowe Hartnett points to his stint in prison as a young man, after a widely publicized conviction for investment fraud during the Great Depression, as the root of his empathy for the underdog in any story. During World War II, the cigar-smoking, bourbon-loving raconteur landed in Charlotte, North Carolina, and founded the <i>Carolina Israelite</i> newspaper, which was published into the 1960s. Golden's writings on race relations and equal rights attracted a huge popular readership. Golden used his celebrity to editorialize for civil rights as the momentous story unfolded. He charmed his way into friendships and lively correspondence with Carl Sandburg, Adlai Stevenson, Robert Kennedy, and Billy Graham, among other notable Americans, and he appeared on the <i>Tonight Show</i> as well as other national television programs. Hartnett's spirited chronicle captures Golden's message of social inclusion for a new audience today.<br><br></p><p>Kimberly Marlowe Hartnett is a writer living in Portland, Oregon. She worked as a journalist for more than thirty years in New England and the Pacific Northwest.This highly readable portrait makes the case for Harry Golden as both a historically significant and truly inimitable character.--Leonard Rogoff, author of <i>Down Home: Jewish Life in North Carolina</i><br>This lively and engaging book brings within a single biographical purview the history of journalism, the South, the civil rights movement, and American Jews.--Stephen J. Whitfield, author of <i>In Search of American Jewish Culture</i><br>In a book both sweeping and meticulous, raucous and thoughtful, Kimberly Marlowe Hartnett not only chronicles the remarkable life of Harry Golden, but gives us new insight into the unique relationship of American Jews and African Americans. It is a superb, enjoyable, and enlightening work.--David Boardman, Dean of the School of Media and Communication, Temple University<br>Harry Golden was a world-class character, a masterful storyteller who used his quick wit and humor to ridicule southern segregation with outrageous but hilarious satire to carve out an improbable place in American and southern Jewish history. We can thank Kimberly Marlowe Hartnett for her well-researched biography, bringing to life for a whole new generation the man who wrote the smashing best-seller called <i>Only in America</i>.--Eli N. Evans, author of <i>The Provincials: A Personal History of Jews in the South</i><br>This honest and humorous volume brings the memory of Harry Golden to life as a man and a public figure, with all his charms and flaws exposed, and puts him in the context of his times. He was an essential partner in the civil rights movement, and the United States could use another Harry Golden today, someone who can puncture political posturing as deftly as he did. Kimberly Marlowe Hartnett shows that doing what Golden did took not only intelligence and imagination but also considerable personal courage.--Jack Claiborne, author of <i>The Charlotte Observer: Its Time and Place, 1896&#x2013;1986</i><br>Kimberly Marlowe Hartnett's fascinating new book, <i>Carolina Israelite</i>, reminds us of the old aphorism that truth is sometimes stranger than fiction. Written in sparkling prose and bristling with insight, her authoritative biography of Harry Golden reconstructs the extraordinary life of a Jewish ex-con from New York who, after resettling in North Carolina in 1941, became a best-selling author and a powerful voice for civil rights and social justice. The author's gift for storytelling rivals that of her protagonist, and the book is a joy to read from start to finish.--Raymond Arsenault, author of <i>Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice</i><br>I've always wondered about the man behind the newspaper the <i>Carolina Israelite</i> and the best-selling book <i>Only in America</i> and now I know: in her engaging and wonderfully written biography, Kimberly Marlowe Hartnett has given us a vivid portrait of a man, a place, and his time.--Daniel Horowitz, author of <i>On the Cusp: The Yale College Class of 1960 and a World on the Verge of Change</i><br><br></p><h2>Clockers</h2><p>Certain that the young Black man who has confessed to a recent murder is covering for his drug-dealing half-brother, Striker, veteran cop Rocco Klein decides to make Striker&#39;s life a nightmare</p><p><p><b>Richard Price</b> is the author of seven novels, including <i>Lush Life, Clockers, Freedomland, </i>and <i>Samaritan</i>. He wrote the screenplays for the films<i> Sea of Love, Ransom,</i> and <i>The Color of Money</i>, for which he received an Academy Award nomination. He won the 2007 Edgar Award for Best TV writing as a co-writer for the HBO series <i>The Wire</i>. Price was also awarded a Literature Award from The American Academy of Arts and Letters. He lives in New York City.</p>Price (The Breaks, 1982, etc.) has spent the past ten years writing for Hollywood (Sea of Love, etc.)--but you wouldn't know it from the dense textures and supple dramatics of this epic slice of urban grit about frazzled drug-dealers and burnt-out cops. Of the many impeccably authentic urban types here, Price focuses on two: 20-ish ``Strike'' Dunham, black chief of a crew of crack-dealers (``clockers'') in the dead-end burg of Dempsy, N.J., and 43-year-old white Dempsy homicide cop Rocco Klein. Each is suffering an identity crisis when a murder puts them on a collision course. Strike, in a constant panic from dealing with his homicidal boss, crack-kingpin Rodney Little, is considering changing jobs; Rocco, six months from retirement, is thinking that his life is a big zero--a nullity underlined by his humiliating antics to curry the favor of a film star who might portray him in a movie. Then someone guns down another of Little's henchmen, and--shocking both Strike and Rocco--Strike's solid-citizen older brother, Victor, confesses to the killing: ``self-defense,'' he claims. Not so, thinks Rocco, who decides that Victor is covering for Strike and starts harassing the young dealer by framing him as a stoolie- -certain death at Little's hands. Meanwhile, myriad subplots vivify Strike's and Rocco's worlds: Rocco initiates the film star into the horrors of jail-life; Strike apprentices a young boy into dealing; Rocco's baby girl disappears; Little's legendary hit man wastes away from AIDS; Strike nearly dies from a bleeding ulcer. Finally, Strike, with a vengeful Little literally steps behind, turns to Rocco for help--a move that allows both to find a kind of hope and renewal. A vital and bold novel rich in unexpected pleasure, with Price generally avoiding melodrama, sentimentality, and stereotype to portray a harsh world with cleareyed compassion. (Film rights sold- -for a highly touted $1.9 million, including Price's screenplay.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The main thesis of this book is that, in the intellectual life, there are only two ultimate alternatives: either the thinker conforms desire to truth or he conforms truth to desire.<br>In the last one hundred years, the western cultural elite embarked upon a project which entailed the reversal of the values of the intellectual life so that truth would be subjected to desire as the final criterion of intellectual value. In looking at recent biographies of such major moderns as Freud, Kinsey, Keynes, Margaret Mead, Picasso, and others, there is a remarkable similarity between their lives and thought. After becoming involved in sexual license early on, they invariably chose an ideology or art form which subordinated reality to the exigencies of their sexual misbehavior.</p><p>"a spicy but serious book ... contoversial but never dull ... written with a style that is both forceful and elegant ..." Esther Littmann,&nbsp;<b>Detroit Free Press</b>.<br><br>"... brilliant ... Jones's book breaks new ground in probing the subtle regions of the human heart where desire confronts truth and rearranges it for its own ends. ... Some might disagree with Jones's use of biography to undermine the central tenets of modernity. Shouldn't theories be considered on their own merits, rather than on the basis of the messy lives of their progenitors? Well, yes - if the theory is truly scientific and therefore subject to what scientists call falsification. ... But modern ideologies are not scientific ... And since many of them began as deliberate distortions of reality, the biographies of their founders are very much to the point." George Sim Johnston,&nbsp;<b>American Spectator</b>.&nbsp;<br><br>" ... provocative ... merits reading by those interested in the history of modern thought ..." Rod Bassett,&nbsp;<b>Journal of Psychology and Christianity</b>.&nbsp;<br><br>"With great insight and incisiveness Jones invesitgates and analyzes some modern paragons of 'thinking' and comes up with the trenchant conclusion that "Modernity is rationalized lust.' Jones is not known for pulling punches, and in this book he lets fly with sharply accurate aim his intellectual fists so that they land right on the chin. ... This is far from doing justice to this great book. 'Take and read.' It will change you." John H. Miller, C.S.C.,&nbsp;<b>Social Justice Review</b>.&nbsp;<br><br>"In his study of the lives and legacies of some of the best-known sexual libertarians of our time, author E.

I know this because I wrote something about it at the time. I have proof. Of course, I can't remember exactly where I wrote about it, or when, but I could probably hunt it up if I had to.<br><br>In my early days of forgetting things, words would slip away, and names. I did what you normally do when this happens: I scrolled through a mental dictionary, trying to figure out what letter the word began with, and how many syllables were involved. Eventually the lost thing would float back into my head, recaptured. I never took such lapses as harbingers of doom, or old age, or actual senescence. I always knew that whatever I'd forgotten was eventually going to come back to me sooner or later. Once I went to a store to buy a book about Alzheimer's disease and forgot the name of it. I thought it was funny. And it was, at the time.<br><br>Here's a thing I've never been able to remember: the title of that movie with Jeremy Irons. The one about Claus von B�low. You know the one. All I ever succeeded in remembering was that it was three words long, and the middle word was "of." For many years, this did not bother me at all, because no one I knew could ever think of the title either. One night, eight of us were at the theater together, and not one of us could retrieve it. Finally, at intermission, someone went out to the street and Googled it; we were all informed of the title and we all vowed to remember it forever. For all I know, the other seven did. I, on the other hand, am back to remembering that it's three words long with an "of" in the middle.<br><br>By the way, when we finally learned the title that night, we all agreed it was a bad title. No wonder we didn't remember it.<br>I am going to Google for the name of that movie. Be right back. . . .<br>It's <i>Reversal of Fortune</i>.<br><br>How is one to remember that title? It has nothing to do with anything.<br><br>But here's the point: I have been forgetting things for years, but now I forget in a new way. I used to believe I could eventually retrieve whatever was lost and then commit it to memory. Now I know I can't possibly. Whatever's gone is hopelessly gone. And what's new doesn't stick.<br><br>The other night I met a man who informed me that he had a neurological disorder and couldn't remember the faces of people he'd met. He said that sometimes he looked at himself in a mirror and had no idea whom he was looking at. I don't mean to minimize this man's ailment, which I'm sure is a bona fide syndrome with a long name that's capitalized, but all I could think was, Welcome to my world. A couple of years ago, the actor Ryan O'Neal confessed that he'd recently failed to recognize his own daughter, Tatum, at a funeral and had accidentally made a pass at her. Everyone was judgmental about this, but not me. A month earlier, I'd found myself in a mall in Las Vegas when I saw a very pleasant-looking woman coming toward me, smiling, her arms outstretched, and I thought, Who is this woman? Where do I know her from? Then she spoke and I realized it was my sister Amy.<br><br>You might think, Well, how was she to know her sister would be in Las Vegas? I'm sorry to report that not only did I know, but she was the person I was meeting in the mall.<br><br>All this makes me feel sad, and wistful, but mostly it makes me feel old. I have many symptoms of old age, aside from the physical. I occasionally repeat myself. I use the expression, "When I was young." Often I don't get the joke, although I pretend that I do. If I go see a play or a movie for a second time, it's as if I didn't see it at all the first time, even if the first time was just recently. I have no idea who anyone in <i>People</i> magazine is.<br><br>I used to think my problem was that my disk was full; now I'm forced to conclude that the opposite is true: it's becoming empty.<br><br>I have not yet reached the nadir of old age, the Land of Anecdote, but I'm approaching it.<br><br>I know, I know, I should have kept a journal.

I'd grown up with a photograph in our den of her standing with my parents backstage at a play they'd written. My mother was wearing a corsage and Eleanor wore pearls. It was a photograph I always thought of as iconic, if I'm using the word correctly, which, if I am, it will be for the first time. We were among the thousands of Americans (mostly Jews) who had dens, and, in their dens, photos of Eleanor Roosevelt. I idolized the woman. I couldn't believe I was going to be in the same room with her. So what was she like that day in Hyde Park, you may wonder. I HAVE NO IDEA. I can't remember what she said or what she wore; I can barely summon up a mental picture of the room where we met her, although I have a very vague memory of drapes. But here's what I do remember: I got lost on the way. And ever since, every time I've been on the Taconic State Parkway, I'm reminded that I got lost there on the way to meet Eleanor Roosevelt. But I don't remember a thing about Eleanor Roosevelt herself.<br><br>In 1964 the Beatles came to New York for the first time. I was a newspaper reporter and I was sent to the airport to cover their arrival. It was a Friday. I spent the weekend following them around. Sunday night they appeared on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i>. You could make an argument that the sixties began that night, on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i>. It was a historic night. I was there. I stood in the back of the Ed Sullivan Theater and watched. I remember how amazingly obnoxious the fans were-the teenage girls who screamed and yelled and behaved like idiots. But how were the Beatles, you may ask. Well, you are asking the wrong person. I could barely hear them.<br><br>I marched on Washington to protest the war in Vietnam. This was in 1967, and it was the most significant event of the antiwar movement. Thousands and thousands of people were there. I went with a lawyer I was dating. We spent most of the day in a hotel room having sex. I am not proud of this, but I mention it because it explains why I honestly cannot remember anything about the protest, including whether I ever even got to the Pentagon. I don't think I did. I don't think I've ever been to the Pentagon. But I wouldn't bet a nickel on it one way or the other.<br><br>Norman Mailer wrote an entire book about this march, called <i>The Armies of the Night</i>. It was 562 pages long. It won the Pulitzer Prize. And I can barely write two paragraphs about it. If you knew Norman Mailer and me and were asked to guess which of us cared more about sex, you would, of course, pick Norman Mailer. How wrong you would be.<br><br>Here are some people I met that I remember nothing about:<br><br>Justice Hugo Black<br>Ethel Merman<br>Jimmy Stewart<br>Alger Hiss<br>Senator Hubert Humphrey<br>Cary Grant<br>Benny Goodman<br>Peter Ustinov<br>Harry Kurnitz<br>George Abbott<br>Dorothy Parker<br><br>I went to the Bobby Riggs-Billie Jean King tennis match and couldn't really see anything from where I was sitting.<br><br>I went to stand in front of the White House the night Nixon resigned and here's what I have to tell you about it: my wallet was stolen.<br><br>I went to many legendary rock concerts and spent them wondering when they would end and where we would eat afterward and whether the restaurant would still be open and what I would order.<br><br>I went to at least one hundred Knicks games and I remember only the night that Reggie Miller scored eight points in the last nine seconds.<br><br>I went to cover the war in Israel in l973 but my therapist absolutely forbid me to go to the front.<br><br>I was not at Woodstock, but I might as well have been because I wouldn't remember it anyway.<br><br>On some level, my life has been wasted on me. After all, if I can't remember it, who can?<br><br>The past is slipping away and the present is a constant affront. I can't possibly keep up. When I was younger, I managed to overcome my resistance to new things. After a short period of negativity, I flung myself at the Cuisinart food processor. I was curious about technology. I became a champion of e-mail and blogs&#x2014;I found them romantic; I even made movies about them. But now I believe that almost anything new has been put on the earth in order to make me feel bad about my dwindling memory, and I've erected a wall to protect myself from most of it.<br><br>On the other side of that wall are many things, pinging. For the most part I pay no attention. For a long time, I didn't know the difference between the Sunnis and the Shias, but there were so many pings I was finally forced to learn. But I can't help wondering, Why did I bother? Wasn't it enough to know they didn't like each other? And in any case, I have now forgotten.<br><br>At this moment, some of the things I'm refusing to know anything about include:<br><br>The former Soviet republics<br>The Kardashians<br>Twitter<br>All Housewives, Survivors, American Idols, and Bachelors<br>Karzai's brother<br>Soccer<br>Monkfish<br>Jay-Z<br>Every drink invented since the Cosmopolitan<br>Especially the drink made with crushed mint leaves.

And there are advantages to it. When you forget something, you can whip out your iPhone and go to Google. The Senior Moment has become the Google moment, and it has a much nicer, hipper, younger, more contemporary sound, doesn't it? By handling the obligations of the search mechanism, you almost prove you can keep up. You can delude yourself that no one at the table thinks of you as a geezer. And finding the missing bit is so quick. There's none of the nightmare of the true Senior Moment-the long search for the answer, the guessing, the self- recrimination, the head-slapping mystification, the frustrated finger-snapping. You just go to Google and retrieve it.<br><br>You can't retrieve your life (unless you're on Wikipedia, in which case you can retrieve an inaccurate version of it).<br><br>But you can retrieve the name of that actor who was in that movie, the one about World War II.

This picture book for older readers introduces a thirteenth-century monk who tried to understand what caused rainbows by doing experiments with light and water. Although the story is highly fictionalized (little is known of Theodoric's personal life), the core is true to Theodoric's studies. The setting is a Dominican monastery where Theodoric lived with his brethren. Curious about rainbows, the other monks offer superstitious stories about the phenomenon, but Theodoric decides to conduct experiments, eventually deducing that drops of water reflect and refract light. The oversize format features dramatic oil paintings that capture both the imagination of Theodoric's work and the medieval milieu. An interesting lesson that is part history and part science, and one that will find use in both classrooms. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>Dark and Stormy Night, A (A Dorothy Martin Mystery, 10)</h2><p><b><i>The new Dorothy Martin mystery</i></b><br><br>When Dorothy Martin and her husband, retired Chief Constable Alan Nesbitt, are invited to a country house weekend, they expect nothing more explosive than the Guy Fawkes fireworks. Having read every Agatha Christie ever written, Dorothy should have known better. Rendered isolated and incommunicado by the storm, Dorothy and Alan nevertheless manage to work out what in the world has been happening at ancient Branston Abbey.</p><p>Jeanne M. Dams, an American, is a devout Anglophile who has wished she could live in England ever since her first visit in 1963. Fortunately, her alter ego, Dorothy Martin, can do just that. Jeanne lives in South Bend, Indiana, with a varying population of cats.Dorothy Martin, with her recent knee replacements, doesn't move as fast as she used to in Dams's stately 10th mystery to feature the retired American schoolteacher living in England (after 2004's Winter of Discontent). Dorothy and her retired chief constable husband, Alan Nesbit, join friends at a restored Kent abbey, now a country house with all the modern conveniences, to celebrate Guy Fawkes Day. Unfortunately, a major storm casts a pall on the house party&#x2014;and blows over an oak tree that reveals a human skeleton tangled in its roots. The discovery in a secret room of a mummy&#x2014;a desiccated female body whose clothes date from the mid&#x2013;20th century&#x2014;adds to the intrigue.

While some of the authors featured in <i>The Anthology of Black Humor</i> are already well known to American readers&#x2014;Swift, Kafka, Rimbaud, Poe, Lewis Carroll, and Baudelaire among them (and even then, Breton&#x2019;s selections are often surprising)&#x2014;many others are sure to come as a revelation.</p><p>The entries range from the acerbic aphorisms of Swift, Lichtenberg, and Duchamp to the theatrical slapstick of Christian Dietrich Grabbe, from the wry missives of Rimbaud and Jacques Vache to the manic paranoia of Dali, from the ferocious iconoclasm of Alfred Jarry and Arthur Craven to the offhand hilarity of Apollinaire at his most spontaneous. For each of the forty-five authors included, Breton has provided an enlightening biographical and critical preface, situating both the writer and the work in the context of black humor a partly macabre, partly ironic, and often absurd turn of spirit that Breton defined as "a superior revolt of the mind."</p><p>"Anthologies can aim to be groundbreaking or thought-provoking; few can be said to have introduced a new phrase or a new concept into the language. No one had ever used the term "black humour" before this one came along, unless, perhaps, it was from a racial angle." <i>The Guardian</i></p><p><b>Andre Breton</b> (1896-1966), the founder and principal theorist of the Surrealist movement, is one of the major literary figures of the past century.

Newton, turned their backs on Martin Luther King's pacifism and, building on Malcolm X's legacy, pioneered a radical new approach to the fight for equality. <i>Waiting 'Til the Midnight Hour</i> is a history of the Black Power movement, that storied group of men and women who would become American icons of the struggle for racial equality.<br><br>Peniel E. Joseph traces the history of the men and women of the movement--many of them famous or infamous, others forgotten. <i>Waiting 'Til the Midnight Hour</i> begins in Harlem in the 1950s, where, despite the Cold War's hostile climate, black writers, artists, and activists built a new urban militancy that was the movement's earliest incarnation. In a series of character-driven chapters, we witness the rise of Black Power groups such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Black Panthers, and with them, on both coasts of the country, a fundamental change in the way Americans understood the unfinished business of racial equality and integration.<br><br>Drawing on original archival research and more than sixty original oral histories, this narrative history vividly invokes the way in which Black Power redefined black identity and culture and in the process redrew the landscape of American race relations.<br><br></p><p>Peniel E.

He lives in Brooklyn, New York.<br> <br>Introduction<br>To Shape a New World<br>&nbsp;<br>Malcolm X arrived in Harlem in the early 1950s on the heels of the contentious departure of another of its adopted, if little-known, sons. As Malcolm was bounding into Harlem's local political arena, Harold Cruse was settling downtown, still clinging to wistful dreams that he had, temporarily at least, put on hold. As a young boy, Harold Cruse dreamed of becoming a writer. For a southern-born black boy coming of age in the Great Depression, this was an ambitious goal, with long odds. Born in Petersburg, Virginia, in 1916, Cruse moved as a young boy to New York City as part of the exodus to northern cities that would shortly transform African American life. The then-largest internal migration in American history sowed the seeds for Harlem's emergence as a cultural mecca that would become the headquarters for black political resistance, intellectual achievement, and cultural innovation. A second great migration, which started during the early 1940s, of southern-born blacks (which eventually eclipsed its earlier counterpart in both density and geographical breadth), extended to cities and regions recently buoyed by the movement for civil rights. Coalitions of civil rights activists, trade unionists, Communists, and Pan-Africanists led strategic campaigns for racial justice and radical democracy that stretched from gritty Harlem neighborhoods through Detroit's industrial shop floors to Dixie's cradle, Birmingham, Alabama, and out west to Oakland's postwar boomtown.1<br>&nbsp;<br>Cruse's favorite time was spent reading books at the local library. It was no ordinary public library. Harlem was home to the New York Public Library's Negro History Division, a repository of black history and culture founded by the Afro-Puerto Rican bibliophile, historian, and curator Arturo Schomburg. Schomburg's passion for African, Caribbean, and African American history provided the residents of Harlem's black community a window onto its past.2<br>&nbsp;<br>In the 1950s, black nationalists stalked Harlem like itinerant Baptist preachers in search of wayward flocks, wistful for the heady post-World War I years, when "New Negroes" reshaped Afro-America with a dose of militancy as effervescent as it was unprecedented. Marcus Mosiah Garvey's dynamic presence had fueled this golden age, when the Universal African Legions (soldiers in Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association) held Harlem captive with precision marching, ornate uniforms, and defiantly proud stares.3 No sooner had Garvey overcome what appeared to be insurmountable organizational, financial, and political obstacles than his movement collapsed, victimized by internal ineptitude, government surveillance, and jealous rivals. Garvey's arrest on charges of mail fraud, and subsequent incarceration during the mid-1920s, made room for other advocates of interracial class struggle who, during the height of the New Negro, could barely be heard above the din of nationalist fervor.<br>&nbsp;<br>If Garvey's absence created space for radicals, the Great Depression invited another front in the war for racial equality: class-based political agitation. With organizing energies fueled by social crises, the Communist Party (CP) made small, but surprisingly robust, headway in Harlem. While Garvey stoked controversy through grand gestures aimed at coaxing dignity from Africa's descendants, the CP offered a Promethean vision of class struggle. As Cruse remembered, anyone who couldn't debate the finer points of Marx and Engels was "considered a goddamned dummy!"4<br>&nbsp;<br>By the late 1930s, the Depression introduced the possibilities of social, cultural, and political revolution at home and abroad and reached Harlem's street corners, barbershops, churches, and other institutions. Much of Cruse's early political education took place at the Harlem YMCA, which served as a debating society, intellectual training ground, and incubator for what Cruse later described as a hotbed of political activity. The all-black neighborhood blurred class distinctions among Afro-Americans, where Harlemites rubbed shoulders with leading black literary lights.5 Virtually every block of Harlem was up for grabs: nationalists exhorting on one corner, while Socialists and others set up their headquarters fifty yards away. Pamphlets on class struggle, Pan-Africanism, and trade unionism compressed decades of social history into easily digestible prose. Walking through parts of Harlem, you risked being bombarded by pamphleteers selling, or sometimes giving away, propaganda that recounted the history of Negro oppression and offered a blueprint for black liberation.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fascism's triumphs in parts of Europe and Africa gave black Americans the opportunity to fight for freedoms abroad that they were denied at home. For blacks the fight against an overseas enemy lent urgency to domestic struggles for racial justice. Stationed in a supply company in Italy and North Africa, Cruse became friendly with Italian Communists. There were pragmatic reasons for such friendships. Preyed on by hijackers and other criminal elements, vulnerable black supply officers negotiated with the Italian Underground as a matter of professional survival and personal protection.6<br>&nbsp;<br>Cruse returned home, more politically conscious and worldly, to a Harlem that had also matured. In fact, postwar New York City became a battleground for some of the most militant and cosmopolitan efforts to achieve racial equality in the United States, and Harlem was the movement's nerve center.7 For instance, seizing opportunities created by postwar momentum for progressive politics, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People--the NAACP--and the Council on African Affairs joined forces to promote a human rights platform for the nascent United Nations.8 Groups such as the National Negro Labor Congress and the Civil Rights Congress, as well as leading black intellectuals (Paul Robeson, Richard Wright, and Langston Hughes among them), established relationships with Communists that ranged from dangerous flirtation to intimate association.9 Communists, through support of black criminal defendants, sharecroppers, trade unionists, artists, and writers, also played an important, hotly debated role among black activists during this period. Black sympathizers, not to mention members, viewed the CP as a potential vehicle for liberation, while anti-Communists suspected the group of playing African Americans for dupes (a fear promoted by the federal government). The majority of black folk remained neutral, accepting the CP's support in certain instances of bald-faced racial injustice while never coming close to becoming professional members. In 1946, Cruse officially joined the Communist Party. Like many in his generation, he entered radical politics at the peak of its post-World War II popularity, only to come of age amid its steady decline during the Cold War.<br>&nbsp;<br>From rural hamlets and small southern cities to giant urban metropolises, the black postwar generation challenged racial discrimination in industry, labor, housing, and domestic and foreign policy. Paul Robeson, the broad-shouldered Renaissance man who possessed the physique of a football player, the mind of an intellectual, and a sonorous bass voice that thrilled a global listening audience, emerged as the most popular spokesperson for black insurgency during the 1940s.10<br>&nbsp;<br>Robeson's radicalism was rooted in his identification with underdogs of every race, color, and creed, an advocacy that found him proclaiming solidarity with indigenous people from Africa to the Soviet Union. Yet while leaders such as Robeson served as invaluable political mobilizers, a national black freedom movement was brokered, block by block, at the local level by far less glamorous figures.11 Ella Baker (future founder of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee), in her capacity as the NAACP's branch director, helped this process unfold in cities like New York through grassroots organizing efforts that stressed cooperation with trade unions affiliated with the left-wing Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).12<br>&nbsp;<br>If the end of the war ushered in dramatic changes for black Americans, it also exposed enduring problems. Wartime race riots, most infamously Detroit's 1943 orgy of violence sparked by competition over jobs and housing, bared the enormity of the unresolved crisis. Rising expectations of black veterans met with racial violence, precarious employment opportunities, and a blatant defense of segregation that found local voice from Harlem to the Mississippi Delta to parts west and national representation among powerful Washington politicians.<br>&nbsp;<br>International events paralleled, and at times intersected with, postwar black freedom struggles; events in Africa proved pivotal in this regard. The rapid decolonization of African states fostered domestic and international pan-African alliances, anchored by the stately presence of Afro-America's legendary intellectual propagandist W. E. B. Du Bois and the controversial outspokenness of Paul Robeson. Domestically, an assortment of militant organizations mirrored these developments, jointly promoting antiracism at home and human rights abroad.13<br>&nbsp;<br>Postwar black activism heralded new hopes for racial justice in every facet of American life, though such hopes were offset by a presidential directive that established a hard peace through the threat of global war. The Truman Doctrine offered a picture of international, multiracial democracy that was, in theory, tantalizingly expansive. In practice, Truman's foreign policies created a domestic political order that sacrificed freedoms of speech and political association, not to mention agendas for racial and economic justice, at the altar of what he proclaimed to be a larger evil--Communist totalitarianism. Remnants of the black freedom struggle responded in different ways to the Cold War's assault on the civil liberties of black radicals. Robeson and Du Bois held steadfast in their commitment to Socialism and paid the price in legal troubles and tarnished reputations. Other, less stalwart, fellow travelers turned government collaborators, informing on ex-comrades. The NAACP navigated the political storms by turning inward, withdrawing from the postwar black liberal-left alliance and opting instead for a more narrow description of racial justice and domestic peace.14<br>&nbsp;<br>Although after World War II black Americans would enjoy new rights, yet more freedoms remained to be claimed; it was the space between new rights and unclaimed freedoms that would fuel Black Power activists. In 1953, amid setbacks for radicals of all stripes and after less than a decade as a Communist, Harold Cruse left the CP. He was not alone. Like his more famous contemporaries, Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison, Cruse grew skeptical of the CP's capacity to lead a political revolution. Indeed, the Communist Party's Depression-era eloquence on race matters--exemplified by its vigorous attacks on segregation as well as the "black belt" thesis that allowed "Negro self-determination," or black nationalism, to penetrate Communist ideology--sagged in subsequent decades, weighed down by an almost evangelical sectarianism.15 Ex-Communists and former radicals responded to the CP's ideological zigzags in different ways, with Ellison embracing American universalism, despite America's stubborn resistance to black inclusion, while Wright searched, until his premature death, for new revolutionary ideals. Cruse settled on a vision of black nationalism--self-determination, unity, and the cultural politics of race--that retained the international awareness he first witnessed on Harlem street corners, read about at the New York Public Library, and experienced through service in World War II and, ironically, the Communist Party. Cruse's disappointment with Communism could be seen in bitter personal relationships with Harlem's leading literary figures, such as Lorraine Hansberry, as well as in his own failures in the field of arts and letters. Operating in social and cultural arenas that claimed pride in an older style of black activism, while at the same time searching for new political horizons, Cruse would be both a participant and a critic of Black Power politics. In his 1967 manifesto, The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual, he charged white Communists and black radicals with failing to recognize that the key to African American liberation resided in the last place anybody cared to look: in the black community's indigenous, cultural, and artistic institutions.<br>&nbsp;<br>The April 1955 Afro-Asian Conference, convened in Bandung, Indonesia, would provide hope for black radicals burned by the Cold War's scalding political climate. Paul Robeson, in his fifth year of domestic confinement after federal authorities stripped him of his passport, greeted the conference as a symbol of the kind of politics--of radical anticolonialism and self-determination--that furthered the commitment to human rights and freedom of expression that was his life's work.16 Presided over by Indonesian president Sukarno and convened by the prime ministers of Indonesia, India, Burma, Ceylon, and Pakistan, the conference featured representatives of twenty-nine nonwhite nations whose populations together exceeded one billion. Bandung's declarations against racism, colonialism, and imperialism represented a watershed event: a "third bloc" opposing both capitalism and totalitarianism. The conference marked the birth of the Non-Aligned Movement, which defied the political requirement that even the tiniest country swear allegiance to the United States or to the Soviet Union. Neutrality, however, had its cost. Behind the scenes in Washington, the State Department observed the entire proceeding with keen interest, despite its public indifference to events in this far corner of the world.17<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In the United States one modest, but powerful, act of political dissent coincided with the radicalism that Bandung expressed in bold strokes. In 1955, the same year as Bandung, Martin Luther King Jr. emerged as the young leader of the Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott. Coupled with 1954's Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation decision, the 1950s would then be christened as the start of the modern civil rights era.18<br>&nbsp;<br>While black southern laborers, preachers, and college students stood poised on the edge of history (destined to be regarded, for the most part, as bit players in an unfolding historical drama; character actors overwhelmed by the glamorous star power and transcendent appeal of Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy),19 participants in the black freedom struggle reinvented themselves as political figures, cultural doyens, magazine editors, and, at times, reform-minded civil rights activists.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the 1950s, many of the activists who had come of age during the war years, such as the members of the Harlem Writers Guild, formed relationships with Malcolm X. On the surface it was an unlikely alliance, since Malcolm represented a religious group--the Nation of Islam--that eschewed political involvement, going so far as to discourage its members from voting, marching on picket lines, or participating in boycotts. Yet Malcolm's personal b...</p><h2>I, Richard</h2><p>Hailed by <i>The New York Times</i> as &#x201c;a master of the British mystery,&#x201d; award-winning author Elizabeth George is one of our most distinguished writers, cherished by readers on both sides of the Atlantic.

Hilarious and sexy, meandering and melancholy, full of inside jokes about Latin American literati that you don't have to understand to enjoy, <i>The Savage Detectives</i> is a companionable and complicated road trip through Mexico City, Barcelona, Israel, Liberia, and finally the desert of northern Mexico. It's the first of Bola�o's two giant masterpieces to be translated into English (the second, <i>2666</i>, is due out next year), and you can see how he's influenced an era. <i>--Tom Nissley</i> <p> <strong>Questions for Translator Natasha Wimmer</strong> </p><p> Natasha Wimmer translated books by Mario Vargas Llosa and Bola�o's good friend Rodrigo Fres�n, among others, before tackling Bola�o's two long novels, <i>The Savage Detectives</i> and the upcoming <i>2666</i>, which have had an immeasurable impact on modern Latin American fiction (and perhaps now on Anglo American writing as well). We asked her a few questions about the process of bringing such a vast and vital book into English. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> How did you come to literary translation, and to translating a work of such prestige? Is the community of Spanish-to-English literary translators small, given Americans' famous lack of interest in translated work? </p><p><strong>Wimmer:</strong> Luck, really. I lived in Spain when I was little, which is where I learned Spanish, and then I studied Spanish literature in college, but it was a job in publishing--at FSG, the publisher of <i>The Savage Detectives</i>--that made me realize that literary translation was something I could try. I&#x2019;ve been translating now for eight years. My first project was a novel by the Cuban writer Pedro Juan Guti�rrez, <i>Dirty Havana Trilogy</i>, and since then I&#x2019;ve worked on books by Mario Vargas Llosa, Gabriel Zaid, Rodrigo Fres�n, and Laura Restrepo. When I read <i>The Savage Detectives</i>, I thought it was one of the best novels I had read in any language in years, but I was sure there was no chance I would get to translate it. Bola�o already had a great translator--Chris Andrews. But Andrews couldn't do it, and I was the extremely fortunate runner-up.</p><p> The community of full-time translators is definitely small--it's hard to make a living. But there are many great occasional translators--professors, editors, writers. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> We're told that Bola�o towers over his generation of writers (and I can believe it). What did he do that was new? What has his influence been? </p><p><strong>Wimmer:</strong> Bola�o was (is) the first to make a true break from the legacy of the Boom. Many other writers of his generation, and younger writers, too, have tried and are still trying to make a literature of their own, one that doesn&#x2019;t languish in the long shadow of Garc�a M�rquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, and the other novelists who exploded on the world scene in the 1960s. Bola�o made the leap seem effortless. The writers of the Boom put Latin America on the map. Bola�o creates a Latin America of the mind, a post-nationalist Latin America filtered through a rootless, restless, uncompromising literary sensibility. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Could you describe Bola�o's style and his sentences? (I love his parentheses.) How did you handle the dozens of voices in <i>The Savage Detectives</i>? </p><p><strong>Wimmer:</strong> Bola�o is both a maximalist and a classicist. He loves to play with excess, with the notion of reckless abandon, but beneath that there is a very careful sense of balance. He was a poet for many years before he became a novelist, and he is an endlessly inventive stylist. But--more rarely for a poet--he also has an unerring sense of character and a palpable fondness for his characters. The Savage Detectives could never have worked otherwise. There are very few writers who could write a novel from the perspective of fifty-odd characters and make each character's story seem urgent and intimate.</p><p> From the translator's perspective, some voices were definitely more difficult than others, but I rarely felt that I had to strain to make them distinct from each other. Mostly, it just involved following Bola�o's cues. The hardest thing, oddly enough, was getting the rhythm of his sentences right. There is something syncopated and unpredictable about them that would have been all too easy to smooth over as a translator, and I made a concerted effort not to do that. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> All of his books are full of references to, and appearances by, Latin American writers both fictional and real and I'm sure as a clueless American reader I'm missing hundreds of inside jokes. What's it like to read his work when you actually know the people he's referring to? </p><p><strong>Wimmer:</strong> It adds a little something, but not as much as you might think. And many of his references are obscure even to Spanish-language readers. There is something cultish and purposefully arcane about the literary world that Bola�o's protagonist, Garc�a Madero, yearns to join, and like Garc�a Madero, the reader is entranced by authors' names and book titles without knowing exactly where they come from. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You are working on translating his other giant masterpiece, <i>2666</i>, the even larger novel that he completed just before his death. How is it going? What can we expect from <i>2666</i>? </p><p><strong>Wimmer:</strong> It's an extremely long novel (1100 pages in the Spanish edition ), so it's a test of stamina, but it's going very well. Like <i>The Savage Detectives</i>, it revolves around a lost writer (Ces�rea Tinajero in <i>TSD</i> and Benno von Archimboldi in <i>2666</i>), and the crucial episodes take place in the north of Mexico, but it is a darker book. The lurking sense of dread that many of the characters feel in <i>TSD</i> becomes something more palpable and sharply defined in <i>2666</i>, and is linked to the killings of women in the Mexican city of Santa Teresa (modeled on Ciudad Ju�rez) and the legacy of the wars of the 20th century, particularly World War II. </p><p><b>Roberto Bola�o</b> was born in Santiago, Chile, in 1953. He grew up in Chile and Mexico City, where he was a founder of the Infrarealist poetry movement. His first full-length novel, <i>The Savage Detectives</i>, received the Herralde Prize and the R�mulo Gallegos Prize when it appeared in 1998. Roberto Bola�o died in Blanes, Spain, at the age of fifty. </p></p><h2>Cora Cooks Pancit</h2><p>Cora loves being in the kitchen, but she always gets stuck doing the kid jobs like licking the spoon.

Back when there were few stars in the sky, people depended on corn for their food. An elderly couple finds that someone?or something?is stealing their cornmeal, and their grandson discovers that the thief is a large spirit dog. The villagers catch the dog in the act, and he runs away. As he leaps into the sky, the cornmeal in his mouth spills out, each grain becoming a star in the Milky Way. The story is told in a clear, straightforward style, with careful attention to the cadence of the language. It is accessible on many levels; it will hold the attention of young listeners, yet remain interesting to older readers. Both Bruchac and Ross provide source notes. The acrylic illustrations depict stylized figures and resemble fabric art. Stroud sets the story in the early 1800s, a time when clothing was made of cloth rather than buckskin, and the colors and textures heighten the applique effect, especially the sprigged calicoes worn by the women.

When Britain attacked the U.S. naval frigate Chesapeake in 1807, Gallatin received a message from Jefferson bidding him to come in haste. 'If you arrive before half after three, come and take a family dinner with me,' Jefferson pleaded, a poignant reminder that, in Jefferson's time, official duties set with the sun... [May] credits Gallatin with ushering in an era of official frugality and mourns that we have "lost sight of the pragmatic, liberal republicanism he practiced"<br> <br><b>George Washington had Alexander Hamilton. Thomas Jefferson had Albert Gallatin.</b><br> <br> From internationally known tax expert and former Supreme Court law clerk Gregory May comes this long overdue biography of the remarkable immigrant who launched the fiscal policies that shaped the early Republic and the future of American politics. Not Alexander Hamilton---Albert Gallatin. To this day, the fight over fiscal policy lies at the center of American politics. Jefferson's champion in that fight was Albert Gallatin---a Swiss immigrant who served as Treasury Secretary for twelve years because he was the only man in Jefferson's party who understood finance well enough to reform Alexander Hamilton's system. A look at Gallatin's work---repealing internal taxes, restraining government spending, and repaying public debt---puts our current federal fiscal problems in perspective. The Jefferson Administration's enduring achievement was to contain the federal government by restraining its fiscal power. This was Gallatin's work. It set the pattern for federal finance until the Civil War, and it created a culture of fiscal responsibility that survived well into the twentieth century.</p><p>An internationally known tax expert, Greg May has spent three years analyzing Gallatin&#39;s role in the finances of the Early Republic. Greg graduated from William and Mary with highest honors in history and from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the law review. After clerking for Justice Lewis Powell on the Supreme Court, he had a long career in tax and corporate finance. He and his wife live in Virginia."'A real Treasure,'&nbsp;wrote James Madison to his friend Jefferson early in his acquaintance with the proud Genevan, then an even-tempered congressman, who would go on to manage the national economy during their two presidencies. As treasury secretary, Albert Gallatin pointed the modest young republic to a debt-free condition, and founding era history remains incomplete without him. His admiring biographer Henry Adams knew that in 1879. But until Gregory May&#x2019;s expansive new life of Gallatin, no scholar had ever fully plumbed the depths of his mind and fleshed out his personality, nor conveyed his politics in such lively prose.

Hesselgrave and Rommen explore the history of contextualization in the Bible and the Church while examining the proposals of prominent thinkers on this subject. They conclude with their own definition and approach to contextualization. Those who have come to expect expert analysis of contextualization from David Hesselgrave will not be disappointed with this work. "His Expertise," writes George Peters, "shines through in this book." <p>Teaming up with Hesselgrave is Ed Rommen, who, according to Peters, is "becoming an authority in practical contextualization." Together they skillfully bring the labyrinth of meanings, proposals, and tasks of contextualization into clearer focus. The result, says Peters, "is the most comprehensive treatise on the subject produced by evangelical scholars." </p><p>The authors survey the history of contextualization in Bible and church history, explore significant proposals of prominent thinkers, and evaluate these proposals from five different perspectives. They conclude their study by outlining their own definition and approach to contextualization, using numerous examples to illustrate their methods.</p></p><p>David J.

They go to town to buy chickens to lay eggs for them instead. For a while, everyone is happy: there are plenty of eggs to bake plenty of yummy things. But the ladies&#39; problems are far from solved, for the more time the chickens spend with the ladies, the more they begin to act like them too, until eventually they stop laying eggs all together. Now this is a problem indeed, but you can be sure, the clever ladies will find a solution. Full of fun and silliness, this lighthearted tale and vibrant illustrations are a delight.</p><p>Bruce McMillan has written and illustrated more children&#x2019;s books set in Iceland than any other United States author. Going Fishing is his sixth to be set there, and his forty-third overall. He often summers in Iceland, though he lives in Shapleigh, Maine. Bruce holds a B.S. in biology from the University of Maine and has received numerous awards and honors for his children&#x2019;s books.<i>Starred Review.</i> Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2013;Set in Iceland, this story is about a community of resourceful women who travel to the city to buy a flock of chickens so that eggs are plentiful in the village. However, the chickens run amok and begin to behave more like ladies than birds. Before long, they stop laying eggs. The resilient women develop a far-fetched plan to solve the problem and the merriment swells to a final, hilarious resolution. The playful text is both silly and joyous, without a wasted word. Gunnella's enchanting oil paintings are full of childlike humor and saturated with appealing primary colors. They convey emotion and absurdity with seemingly simple lines and expressive body language. These spirited, buxom ladies and beguiling chickens will be remembered long after the book has been closed. A funny and inventive choice that is also a charming tribute to Icelandic culture and tradition.<i>&#x2013;Mary Hazelton, Elementary Schools in Warren &amp; Waldoboro, ME</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her true story has been an inspiration to thousands. She discusses: <ul><li>Dealing with times of adversity</li><li>Understanding true conversion</li><li>Overcoming suffering</li><li>Developing strong faith</li><li>Hearing God's voice</li></ul>Guyon's life demonstrates how the love of God can overcome all the trials believers face. This book is a living testimony of the undying faith she found as she experienced the joy of the Lord in the midst of suffering. Discover how you, too, can live joyously, regardless of your circumstances.</p><p>Jeanne Guyon (1648-1717) was a Christian contemplative and writer. Being contemplative refers to what is sacredly obscure or secret, something that is remote from human comprehension. It reflects the search for a deeper spiritual life, for fellowship and oneness with the omniscient, omnipotent God who is also our Father.<br> Guyon wrote from the depth of her own spiritual experiences. Growing up in France during the decadent times of Louis XIV, she was devout at an early age, but was then caught up in the worldliness around her. After an arranged marriage at age fifteen, she became increasingly interested in spiritual things; and, for the rest of her life, she continued to seek God diligently, teach others, and write books on Christian devotion. These books have become Christian classics.<br> Guyon paid a heavy price for her views and her writings. Throughout her life, she underwent various trials, including persecution and imprisonment for her beliefs. Her commentary on Song of Songs was used to sentence her to prison.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Teachings of the Essenes from Enoch to the Dead Sea Scrolls</h2><p>Nearly two thousand years have passed since the Son of Man taught the way, the truth and the life to mankind. He brought health to the sick, wisdom to the ignorant and happiness to those in misery. His words became half forgotten and were not collected till some generations after they were uttered. They have been misunderstood, wrongly annotated, hundreds of times rewritten and hundreds of times transformed, yet they have nevertheless survived almost two thousand years. And though his words, as we have them to-day in the New Testament, have been terribly mutilated and deformed, they nevertheless have conquered half of humanity and the whole of the civilization of the West. This fact proves the eternal vitality of the Master&#39;s words, and their supreme and incomparable value. For this reason we have decided to publish the pure, original words of Jesus, translated directly from the Aramaic tongue spoken by Jesus and his beloved disciple John, who alone among Jesus&#39; disciples noted with perfect accuracy, his Master&#39;s personal teachings. The Teachings of the Essenes from Enoch to the Dead Sea Scrolls is the vital key to guide the reader and interpret the Communions with Angels of Earth and Heaven. Without this book the reader may feel lost in the splendid biblical poetry of the second, and larger volume of the Gospels.</p><p></p><h2>On Division: A Novel</h2><p><p>&#x201c;A novel of wisdom and uncertainty, of love in its greater and lesser forms, and of the struggle between how it should be and how it is.

Her ten children range in age from thirteen to thirty-nine. Her in-laws, postwar immigrants from Romania, live on the first floor of their house. Her daughter Tzila Ruchel lives on the second. She and Yidel, a scribe in such demand that he makes only a few Torah scrolls a year, live on the third.

Surie is pregnant. Pregnant at fifty-seven. It is a shock. And at her age, at this stage, it is an aberration, a shift in the proper order of things, and a public display of private life.

And so for the first time in her life, she has a secret&#x2015;a secret that slowly separates her from the community.</p><p>Goldie Goldbloom's <i>On Division </i>is an excavation of one woman's life, a story of awakening at middle age, and a thoughtful examination of the dynamics of self and collective identity.

Just as the surviving traces of Plato in Freud were to identify reality-testing with a cognition freed of its sexual past, even so Lear attempts his own version of Kierkegaard's "The Case of the Contemporary Disciple."

He asserts that irony itself has been regularly confused with sarcasm; it is often mistakenly assumed that irony and earnestness cannot go together. <br><br>This book, then, is not merely about the therapeutic action of psychoanalysis--it is an enactment of conceptual therapy.

Jonathan Lear&#x2019;s new work is concerned with not simply a mere change of belief that emerges out of conversation, not even massive changes of belief. Nor is he concerned only with changes in emotional life. Rather, he is concerned with basic changes in the ways the psyche functions. How could any conversation have such a result? There are three areas of inquiry which have addressed this question: religion, philosophy and psychoanalysis. Within psychoanalysis the form this question takes is: what is the therapeutic action of psychoanalysis? That is, what is it about the peculiar nature of psychoanalytic conversation that facilitates fundamental psychic change? <p>This book argues that, properly understood, irony plays a crucial role in therapeutic action. However, this insight has been difficult to grasp because the concept of irony has itself been distorted, covered over. It is regularly confused with sarcasm; it is often mistakenly assumed that if one is speaking ironically, one must mean the opposite of what one says, that one must be feigning ignorance, that irony and earnestness cannot go together. All of these assumptions are false. So, part of the therapeutic action of this book is conceptual therapy: we need to recover a vibrant sense of irony. </p><p>This book, then, is not merely about the therapeutic action of psychoanalysis, it is an enactment of conceptual therapy. It is thus written as an invitation to clinicians &#x2013;psychologists, psychoanalysts, psychiatrists &#x2013; to renew their own engagement with the fundamental concepts of their practice. To that end, the book investigates the concepts of subjectivity and objectivity that are appropriate for psychoanalysts, the concept of internalization and of transference. There is also an extended discussion of the theories of Hans Loewald and Paul Gray &#x2013; and how they do and do not fit together. The very idea that love, or Eros, could be a drive &#x2013; as Freud postulated &#x2013; is given a new interpretation. </p><p>Therapeutic Action will be of interest to anyone concerned with the central concepts of psychoanalysis. And, indeed, to anyone interested in how conversation can bring about fundamental psychic change. </p><p>"Jonathan Lear&#x2019;s Therapeutic Action vindicates its Oscar Wildean subtitle&#x2014;An Earnest Plea for Irony&#x2014;by giving us a Kierkigaardian reading, not so much of Hans Loewald, but of the transferences between Loewald and Lear. Just as the surviving traces of Plato in Freud was to identify reality-testing with a cognition freed of its sexual past, even so Lear attempts his own version of Kierkegaard&#x2019;s &#x2018;The Case of the Contemporary Disciple&#x2019;. Lear is Plato to Loewald&#x2019;s Socrates, which is an audacious venture. Therapeutic Action has the high merit of helping me to rethink some of my own transferences."&#x2014;Harold Bloom </p><p>"Jonathan Lear&#x2019;s psychoanalytic and philosophical sophistication have enabled him to produce a lucid, incisive, and convincing argument about how psychoanalysis leads to a better life through a particular deployment of the capacity for love. Anyone who loves rigorous, creative argument will find this encounter with Lear and his thinking about why the analytic conversation is transforming an intellectual experience of the highest and most exciting order. This is one of those rare books that can actually let you change the way you think and the way you live." &#x2014;Robert A. Paul, Ph.D. </p><p> "In this bold and intriguing book, Jonathan Lear asks: how do psychoanalysts communicate not with their patients but with each other? Do the forms of psychoanalytic writing continue to reflect a distorted notion of scientific rigor? Do analysts in writing about therapeutic action ignore a key insight: that what they say matters less than how they say it? Does the health of the psychoanalytic profession currently hinge on analysts becoming more aware of how the form of their communication affects their lives as analysts? With these provocative questions, Lear returns to his own point of departure as an analyst: his conversations with Hans Loewald and Loewald&#x2019;s paper on the therapeutic action of psychoanalysis. Honoring the dying wish of his mentor, he seeks to discover in a field riddled with discipleship how not to become a disciple. And with this ultimately personal &#x2018;how-not-to&#x2019; book, Lear engages the difficult question: how to write about the process of psychic change without betraying either love or science. Therapeutic Action will enliven the thinking of anyone involved in analyzing the psyche." &#x2014;Carol Gilligan, author of In a Different Voice and The Birth of Pleasure</p></p><h2>What Makes Olga Run?: The Mystery of the 90-Something Track Star and What She Can Teach Us About Living Longer, Happier Lives</h2><p><p><b>A fascinating look at the way we age today and the extent to which we can shape the process</b></p><p>In <i>What Makes Olga Run?</i> Bruce Grierson explores what the wild success of a ninety-four-year-old track star can tell us about how our bodies and minds age. Olga Kotelko is not your average ninety-four-year-old. She not only looks and acts like a much younger woman, she holds over twenty-three world records in track and field, seventeen in her current ninety to ninety-five category. Convinced that this remarkable woman could help unlock many of the mysteries of aging, Grierson set out to uncover what it is that's driving Olga. He considers every piece of the puzzle, from her diet and sleep habits to how she scores on various personality traits, from what she does in her spare time to her family history. Olga participates in tests administered by some of the world's leading scientists and offers her DNA to groundbreaking research trials. What emerges is not only a tremendously uplifting personal story but a look at the extent to which our health and longevity are determined by the DNA we inherit at birth, and the extent to which we can shape that inheritance. It examines the sum of our genes, opportunities, and choices, and the factors that forge the course of any life, especially during our golden years.</p></p><p><b>Bruce Grierson</b> is the author of the books <i>Culture Jam</i> and <i>U-Turn</i>. He has been a freelance writer for twenty-five years. His work has appeared in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i> and <i>Psychology Today</i>, among other publications. He lives in North Vancouver, Canada.<p>Prologue</p> <p>Ever since she turned 90, Olga Kotelko has presented a problem for organizers of the track meets she enters: Whom does she compete against?</p> <p>The issue surfaced prominently in the 60-meter-dash final at the World Masters Indoor Athletics Championships, in Kamloops, British Columbia, in 2010. Olga found herself, well, in a class by herself. There just aren&#x2019;t many nonagenarian sprinters&#x2014;even when you draw from the whole planet. The next-oldest woman in this meet, Californian Johnnye Vallien, was 84.</p> <p>So there Olga was, 91, bespandexed and elfin, lumped in with the men.</p> <p>In lane one stood Orville Rogers, 91, a long-striding retired Braniff Airways pilot and the world-record holder in the mile for men over 90. Next to him: Belgian Emiel Pauwels, 90, another world-record middle-distance man (1,500-meter), in bright orange track spikes, who would later make everyone nervous as he ran most of the 3,000-meter final with his left shoelace untied. Front and center: Ugo Sansonetti, 92, a former frozen-food magnate from Rome, in a blue sleeveless skinsuit, his tanned biceps bulging like small baked potatoes.</p> <p>Olga drew the inside lane, rounding out the field. She wore black tights and a long-sleeved white shirt&#x2014;the modest uniform she wears no matter the weather.</p> <p>She&#x2019;d been worried about her start. She&#x2019;s not a good starter. She can get rattled. Sometimes, when the gun sounds or even a fraction of a second before, she takes a step <i>backward</i>. But today she started clean and mechanically strong, piston-pumping her arms, generating enough wind to pin her hair back a bit.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s no longer strange to see geriatric runners: every big-city marathon has its share of valiant, white-haired competitors who spark bursts of applause as they shuffle past. But it <i>is</i> strange to watch 90-year-olds sprint. Kids and dogs and young adults run full-out. But old folks? The incongruity of that image inspired a television commercial that Ugo Sansonetti shot for Bertolli margarine not long ago. A runaway baby carriage is seen careening through the streets of Rome, until a fissure-faced old bystander&#x2014;Ugo&#x2014;springs into action and chases it down.</p> <p>Sansonetti crossed the line first at Kamloops, in a world-record time of 11.57 seconds. He bounced around in the run-off area, arms overhead in triumph, as Rogers glided in behind him at 12.82. Olga came third, at just over 15 seconds. She looked concerned for Pauwels, the Belgian, who had caught a spike and crashed down hard, then picked himself up and limped in last.</p> <p>She was cool with running against the guys. &#x201c;That one fellow was pretty fast,&#x201d; she said, on the way to the changing area. She had gotten used to this. When you&#x2019;re the fastest 91-year-old woman on the planet, either you compete against younger women or you run against the guys.</p> <p><br>Just how good is Olga? There are a couple of ways to put her in perspective.</p> <p>She currently holds twenty-six world records. She set twenty world records in a single year, 2009. She hits these totals in part by entering more events than everybody else, including a couple that nobody else in the world her age attempts. She will often do six throwing events, three sprints, and three jumps. (At age 88, she considered adding the pole vault, but was deterred by practical considerations. &#x201c;What do you do with the pole&#x2014;strap it to the roof of the car? Check it on to the plane?&#x201d;)</p> <p>Track records, at the elite level, tend to fall by fingernail parings of time and distance: fractions of seconds, portions of inches. At the 2009 World Masters Athletics Championships in Lahti, Finland, Olga threw a javelin almost <i>twenty feet</i> farther than her nearest rival. At the World Masters Games in Sydney, Australia, in 2009, Olga&#x2019;s time in the 100-meter dash&#x2014;23.95 seconds&#x2014;would have won the women&#x2019;s 80&#x2013;84 division&#x2014;two age brackets down.</p> <p>Olga stands five feet and a half an inch. She weighs 130 pounds. For her size&#x2014;and this may be the most curious thing about her&#x2014;she has extraordinary power. It can be surprising, after her slo-mo windup, to see how far the things she throws go.</p> <p>On the hammer throw pitch in Kamloops, she took her place with the other competitors. Big guys with leather gloves paced around, shaking their hands out. Olga removed her glasses. There was a sudden and brief sense of menace; when a little old lady starts swinging a three-pound cannonball around her head, a good outcome is not guaranteed. But the thing sailed, straight and true. &#x201c;If I spun I could throw it farther,&#x201d; Olga says, but after watching somebody very old fall that way she has decided not to risk it.</p> <p>Olga got more leg into the second throw. But the trajectory wasn&#x2019;t what she liked. She made a little swan&#x2019;s head gesture with her hand, to remind herself. Routinely, Olga performs better on every subsequent attempt as she recalibrates and tries again. It&#x2019;s like watching a marksman bracket the bull&#x2019;s-eye and then draw in: 12.72 meters. 13.37. 13.92. In ten minutes she added four feet of distance. &#x201c;New world record,&#x201d; a disembodied voice said over the loudspeaker.</p> <p>There is a formula called &#x201c;age-grading&#x201d; that&#x2019;s used to put the performances of older athletes in perspective. Age-graded scores tell us how impressed we should be by what a masters athlete&#x2014;placed in categories from ages 35 to 105&#x2014;just did. A set of tables plots a given performance against the expected decline of the human body, and expresses it as a percentage. So, theoretically, 100 percent is the high-water mark for a human being of that age.</p> <p>But a number of Olga&#x2019;s marks&#x2014;in shot put, high jump, 100-meter dash&#x2014;top 100 percent. In Sydney she threw the shot put 5.6 meters&#x2014;which age-grades out at 119 percent. If you plug Olga&#x2019;s 23.95 100-meter-dash time from Sydney into the tables, you find it&#x2019;s exactly equivalent to American Olympian Florence Griffith Joyner&#x2019;s prevailing, suspicious, and thought-to-be-untouchable world record of 10.49 seconds.</p> <p>Remarkably, when you age-grade, you find Olga is not only holding her own but in some cases getting better&#x2014;which suggests that either the tables are wonky or Olga is. Most likely both are true. &#x201c;She throws off the curve, because she&#x2019;s doing things nobody&#x2019;s ever done,&#x201d; says Ken Stone, editor of masters-track.com, the watering hole of the masters track community. (Motto: &#x201c;Older, Slower, Lower.&#x201d;) But at the same time, some recent performances speak for themselves. &#x201c;I threw the hammer farther this year than I did two years ago,&#x201d; she mentioned recently, offhandedly. &#x201c;How do you explain that?&#x201d; No two ways about it: Olga is defying, or rewriting, our understanding of the retention of human physical capability.</p> <p>When people hear how old she is, they seem to look at her more deeply, at her face. To be blunt: she is not aging normally.</p> <p>&#x201c;How old do you <i>feel</i>?&#x201d; I asked her on her 91st birthday.</p> <p>She thought about that. &#x201c;Fifty?&#x201d; She gave a half shrug. &#x201c;I still have the energy I had at fifty,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;More. Where is it coming from? Honestly, I don&#x2019;t know. I wish I knew. It&#x2019;s a mystery even to me.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>They say she is like Grandma Moses, in the sense that she found her calling very late in life. But while Grandma Moses took up painting out of desperation, to make ends meet, Olga took up track, at age 77, for fun. A dozen years retired from her career as an elementary school teacher, she still had lightning in her that needed grounding.</p> <p>For the first half of her track career&#x2014;till around age 85&#x2014;she coasted under the radar, quietly breaking world records within a subculture obscure enough (track and field for old people!) that many people still don&#x2019;t know it exists. But since she turned 90, media interest in Olga has made it hard for her to hide. Reporters from around the world have made pilgrimages to her home on the flank of Hollyburn Mountain, overlooking the Pacific Ocean in West Vancouver. There is usually pleasant chitchat, and the reporter, having heard the jokes that the fountain of youth burbles up in her backyard, just behind the organic vegetable garden, makes an excuse to snoop around.</p> <p>Because, seriously: when you&#x2019;re breaking records, rather than hips, at an age most people will never live to see . . . what gives?</p> <p>Aging is supposed to be one of those nonnegotiables: just the cost of doing life. It is, as the Stanford professor of medicine Walter Bortz put it, &#x201c;a stern expression of the Second Law of Thermodynamics from which there is no respite.&#x201d; So how do you begin to think about someone like Olga, short of demanding to see her birth certificate or otherwise trying to debunk her story? What seems to be required is a leap in the way we understand the aging process, as scientific advancements slowly reveal clues.</p> <p>Indeed, for a stage of life that 90 million baby boomers in North America alone are barreling toward, surprisingly little is known about old age. (Or maybe it&#x2019;s not so surprising: old age was a nonissue in human history until very recently. More than half the people <i>who have ever</i> reached age 65 are alive today, some demographers believe.)</p> <p>But lack of data has never stood in the way of forceful opinion. Just about everyone has a guess about what makes Olga run. It&#x2019;s genes. It&#x2019;s diet. It&#x2019;s temperament. It&#x2019;s her unusual paleo sleep patterns. It&#x2019;s the fighting spirit of the Cossack general from whom she is descended. It&#x2019;s energy: she is vibrating at a higher frequency than most anyone else. It&#x2019;s the miracle of exercise itself, compounded over a long, long lifetime. It&#x2019;s performance-enhancing drugs. (Actually, we can rule that one out: she&#x2019;s clean.)</p> <p>In the morning&#x2014;very early or merely early, depending on the day&#x2014;Olga gets up and puts the kettle on for Krakus, a Polish coffee substitute made from roasted flax, barley, and beetroot. Then she heads into the bathroom to wash her face. The woman looking back at her in the mirror contains multitudes. She is the sweet-natured grandma with a competitive streak so ferocious she aims to set marks that eclipse the past greats and make up-and-comers think about maybe trying out scrapbooking instead. The farm girl who outlived ten siblings and one of her two daughters, and ponders what is being asked of her, the survivor. The levelheaded pragmatist with abiding faith in water, reflexology, and a curious routine of massaging and stretching her muscles in the dead of night.</p> <p>Olga and I met four years ago. I was one of those nosy writers who showed up at her home: the in-law apartment in the basement of her daughter and son-in-law&#x2019;s house.</p> <p>It was a tidy space. Her own paintings of landscapes, marinas, and flowers from the garden hung on the walls. She offered tea. She had kind eyes and carefully applied lipstick and a shy demeanor. It was hard to reconcile this gentle person with the figure conjured by the growing mythology&#x2014;a woman whose warrior fire is so intense that when she first announced she was interested in track, and a well-meaning friend said, &#x201c;The event you want is the racewalk,&#x201d; the advice literally did not make sense to her. Seriously? Walking or racing: which were they talking about here?</p> <p>I&#x2019;d hoped we could go to the running oval at the local high school so I could observe Olga in action. But it was pounding rain outside, so instead we stayed in and talked. We went through her notebooks documenting thirteen years of increasingly unlikely levels of achievement in track and field. At the end she cracked open the door to a closet. It looked like what Geraldo had hoped to find in Al Capone&#x2019;s vault. Gold shone forth. Hundreds of medals hung from groaning hooks.</p> <p>If a writer can become infected by a story, that&#x2019;s what happened to me that day. Olga started to feel more interesting, more <i>important</i> than everything else I was thinking about. She&nbsp;tolerated my endless questions, probably because they were the same kinds of questions she had about herself. Eventually we&nbsp;struck a deal: we would become a team. We would explore the mystery of her together. She would offer herself up to science while I took notes. We would tap the expertise of some of the top practitioners of exercise physiology and gerontology, neuropsychology and evolutionary medicine.</p> <p>To be honest, I had a secondary, selfish motive. I felt a personal stake in what the data about Olga would reveal, because I had my own mystery to solve.</p> <p>You see, I used to be fit, too&#x2014;not Olga-fit, but fit. I started exercising, in a pretty committed and deliberate way, when I was a skinny kid of nine. I got good tennis coaching and started beating adults, via a style of steady, craven retrieval that wore them out (and ticked them off). A running addiction that took hold around age twenty ensured that I kept grinding out workouts into my thirties and forties. Pairs of Nikes&#x2014;each dutifully retired after six hundred miles&#x2014;piled up in the closet like cordwood until:</p> <p>Boom. Something . . . gave. Age flooded in all at once. It really did feel that sudden. Gone, just like that, the jump, the stamina, the drive, the memory, the hair. Gone, any right to use the noun &#x201c;performance,&#x201d; in any context. And with those changes came a fairly radical shift in attitude. Each sunrise no longer dialed up a sense of hope but resignation.</p> <p>How does this happen? I was 47. Could it be the inevitable midlife swoon we&#x2019;re warned about, the one that starts with stretch jeans and topical ibuprofen and ends up with saltless dinners in the extended-care wing? Well, clearly it&#x2019;s not inevitable, because there before me was Olga. Whatever was happening with her was the opposite of what was happening to me. If she was the paragon of healthy aging, I was a proxy for every once-hale boomer now alarmingly on the skids.</p> <p>Some serious sleuthing was in order. It would require going back in time to peek in on Olga as her current self was still under construction. What was she doing, at my age and younger, that was so forward-thinking, so right (or maybe just so lucky)? And could those habits be wrenches to fix the mistakes the rest of us are making, before it&#x2019;s too late?</p> <p><br>Copyright � 2014 by Bruce Grierson</p></p><h2>Cherry Tree Farm Story Collection</h2><p>Cherry Tree Farm</p><p>Enid Blyton&#39;s books have sold over 500 million copies and have been translated into other languages more often than any other children&#39;s author.

Nichols undertakes the long process of restoring and designing the garden at &#34;Allways&#34;, Huntingdonshire as a self-confessed amateur with little or no knowledge of horticulturalism, having been seduced by the vibrant illustrations of bulb catalogues and the hazy ideal of the cottage garden. The development of the project through the seasons unfolds in detail as Nichols introduces the reader to a gallery of characters along the way, from the formidable Mrs M. to Mr Honey, the engimatic nurseryman who only speaks in Latin.</p><p>Down the Garden Path has stood the test of time as one of the world&#39;s best-loved and most-quoted gardening books. Ostensibly an account of the creation of a garden in Huntingdonshire in the 1930s, it is really about the underlying emotions and obsessions for which gardening is just a cover story. The secret of this book&#39;s success---and its timelessness---is that it does not seek to impress the reader with a wealth of expert knowledge or advice. Beverley Nichols proudly declares his status as a newcomer to gardening: &#34;The best gardening books should be written by those who still have to search their brains for the honeysuckle&#39;s languid Latin name...&#34; As unforgettable as the plants in the garden is the cast of visitors and neighbors who invariably turn up at inopportune moments. For every angelic Miss Hazlitt there is an insufferable Miss Wilkins waiting in the wings. For every thought-provoking Professor, there is an intrusive Miss M, whose chief offense may be that she is a &#39;damnably efficient&#39; gardener. From a disaster building a rock garden, to further adventures with greenhouses, woodland gardens, not to mention cats and treacle, Nichols has left us a true gardening classic.Beverley Nichols (1898&#x2013;1983) was a prolific writer on subjects ranging from religion to politics and travel, in addition to authoring six novels, five detective mysteries, four children's stories, six autobiographies, and six plays. He is perhaps best remembered today for his gardening books. The first of them, <i>Down the Garden Path,</i> centered on his home and garden at Glatton and has been in print almost continuously since 1932. <i>Merry Hall</i> (1951) and its sequels <i>Laughter on the Stairs</i> (1953) and <i>Sunlight on the Lawn</i> (1956) document Nichols' travails in renovating a Georgian mansion and its gardens soon after the war. His final garden was at Sudbrook Cottage, which serves as the setting for <i>Garden Open Today</i> (1963) and <i>Garden Open Tomorrow</i> (1968). The progress of all three gardens was followed avidly by readers of his books and weekly magazine columns.</p><h2>A Diary of Private Prayer</h2><p>With over a million copies in print, John Baillie&#x2019;s classic collection of scripture and prayers is a beautiful daily devotional, the perfect companion guide to any Christian seeking to enrich their life through growth in prayer.<br><br>In this book of personal devotions, noted theologian Dr. John Baillie offers personal prayers for people who are seeking a better understanding of God and themselves.
